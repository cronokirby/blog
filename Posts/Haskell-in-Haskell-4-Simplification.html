<p>In this post we'll be writing a <strong>simplifier</strong> for our subset of Haskell.
We'll be transforming and trimming down our AST to make it more suitable for type-checking,
and easier to convert to lower-level representations.</p><!--more-->
<p>So far, we've mainly been working on what's called the <em>frontend</em> of our compiler.
This goes from the source code that the user deals with, and gives us a representation
of that code we can work with. Now we're starting work on the middle part of our compiler,
which analyzes and transforms this representation, preparing it for the <em>backend</em>,
which will generate the C so that our program can be executed.</p>
<p>We'll be going over a handful topics:</p>
<ul><li>What does our simplifier need to do anyways?</li><li>What kind of information do we need for the types defined in our program?</li><li>How do we resolve the type synonyms that the user created?</li><li>What redundant parts of the syntax tree can be rewritten?</li><li>How do we unify multiple function heads into simple case expressions?</li></ul>
<p>By the end of this post, we'll have seen approaches to these questions and problems,
and created a compiler stage putting these ideas into practice.</p>
<h1>What our simplifier needs to do</h1>
<p>Our main goal for this part is creating a <em>simplifier</em>. But what is
this simplifier trying to accomplish in the first place? There's no single
answer, because the simplifier is ultimately a stage that exists to tie a few loose
knots and tidy up a few things we've left open after the parsing stage.</p>
<p>Right now, after parsing, our representation of the code is very similar
to the source code we've just extracted it from. What we aim to do in this stage
is to transform this source level representation into something that's much easier
to work with for the stages that come after us.</p>
<p>We'll need to untangle type and value information, which are currently mixed in
our representation, in the same way that Haskell lets you define both types and values
in the same file. We'll also be streamlining our representation of values, simplifying
the various constructs in our language, and desugaring a lot of the syntax that
our parser previously left untouched.</p>
<p>We'll also be taking this opportunity to do some basic checks on the integrity
of our code, reporting different errors as we transform our syntax tree. These errors
are natural extensions of the kind of transformations we want to do.</p>
<h2>Type Information</h2>
<p>As we've just gone over, Haskell mixes type information and value information,
and one goal of this stage is going to be to untangle the two parts.</p>
<p>Take a snippet of Haskell like this:</p>
<pre><code>type X = Int

data MyData = MyData X

x :: MyData
x = MyData 3</code></pre>
<p>Here we have 4 items of interest:</p>
<ol><li>The type synonym <code>X = Int</code></li><li>A data definition creating a new type <code>MyData</code></li><li>A type annotation for <code>x</code></li><li>A value definition for <code>x</code></li></ol>
<p>Items 1 and 2 are squarely in the realm of types, and 4 in
the realm of values. Item 3 gives us a type for this value.</p>
<p>One inconvenient aspect of our current representation is that all of these kinds
of things are scattered throughout our source code, without any
clean separation or organization.</p>
<p>The first problem is that the potential type annotation for a value is separate from
that value. In fact, values can be declared multiple times, to allow us to provide pattern
matching, like:</p>
<pre><code>add 0 0 = 0
add n m = n + m</code></pre>
<p>We'll want to unify all the definitions of <code>add</code> into one part of our syntax tree,
and bring it together with whatever type annotation it might have had.</p>
<p>We also don't really need to lug around the syntax for all the type information
the user is providing us. What we really want to do is to <em>distill</em> all of this information
and only keep track of the parts we need for later.</p>
<h3>Type Synonyms</h3>
<p>Type synonyms don't actually need to be kept around, if you think about it.
When we create a type synonym and use it:</p>
<pre><code>type X = Int

add :: X -> X -> X</code></pre>
<p>what we're really saying is that this program is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>add :: Int -> Int -> Int</code></pre>
<p>and the type synonym can be eliminated completely for later stages.</p>
<p>This applies equally even if that synonym is used inside of a data type:</p>
<pre><code>type X = Int

data MyData = MyData X</code></pre>
<p>This program can be replaced with:</p>
<pre><code>data MyData = MyData Int</code></pre>
<p>without changing its meaning at all.</p>
<p>So, we can really discard all of the type synonyms, but only <em>after</em> we've replaced
all of their occurrences with a fully resolved type. We need to be careful here, since type synonyms
can reference other synonyms:</p>
<pre><code>type X = Y
type Y = Z
type Z = Int</code></pre>
<p>We can't simply make a map <code>Synonym -> ResolvedType</code> by looking at each synonym in the file.
Instead we'll need to do a bit more work to figure out what this map looks like. Regardless,
we'll be using a map like this to eliminate all of the synonyms eventually, and we can discard
that map before the next stage, since every type will have been fully resolved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] <strong>Note:</strong>
If you want to provide nicer errors to the user, then you actually <em>do</em> want to keep this map around,
so that you can reference the type synonms that a user provided when talking about errors.</p>
<p>For example, if you have:</p>
<pre><code>type X = Int

x :: X
x = "foo"</code></pre>
<p>It'd be nice to say something like "couldn't match type <code>X</code> with <code>String</code>" than
"couldn't match type <code>Int</code> with <code>String</code>", since it's closer to the code the user provided.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Constructor Information</h3>
<p>The remaining bit of type information we need to keep track of are the
new data types defined by the user. When we have some data type like:</p>
<pre><code>data List a = Cons a (List a) | Nil</code></pre>
<p>we'll then need to keep track of the two constructors:</p>
<pre><code>Nil :: List a
Cons :: a -> List a -> List a</code></pre>
<p>We can't get rid of these just yet, since we need to use them for type checking in
the next stage. After all, we need to recognize bad usages, like:</p>
<pre><code>Cons 3 3</code></pre>
<p>for example.</p>
<h2>Redundancy</h2>
<p>So, we want to extract out the type information strewn across
our program, but what about the values? We're not going to leave them untouched either.</p>
<p>As mentioned a few times in the last post, our syntax tree after parsing is very
close to the syntax of the language, and has quite a few redundant constructs. These constructs
exist because there is syntax for them, and not because they represent truly distinct
programs.</p>
<p>Another major goal in our simplifier is going to be trimming the fat on our syntax tree,
and simplifying away all of this redundancy.</p>
<h3>Let vs Where</h3>
<p>The first bit of redundant syntax are <code>let</code> expressions and <code>where</code> expressions. Syntactically,
these are different, but they really express the same thing. We can represent
a <code>where</code> expression like:</p>
<pre><code>x + y
  where
    x = 2
    y = 3</code></pre>
<p>using <code>let</code> instead:</p>
<pre><code>let x = 2
    y = 3
in x + y</code></pre>
<p>By doing this throughout our syntax tree, we get rid of one superfluous constructor in
our tree, which simplifies our work throughout the remaining stages of our compiler.</p>
<h3>Lambdas</h3>
<p>Syntactically, we allow lambdas with multiple parameters at once:</p>
<pre><code>\x y -> x + y</code></pre>
<p>Our syntax tree represents this verbatim, as:</p>
<pre><code>LambdaExpr ["x", "y"] (BinExpr Add (NameExpr "x") (NameExpr "y"))</code></pre>
<p>It's common knowledge that this snippet of Haskell is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>\x -> \y -> x + y</code></pre>
<p>And we could have parsed our original expression as:</p>
<pre><code>LambdaExpr ["x"] (LambdaExpr ["y"] ...)</code></pre>
<p>matching the second version. We've chosen to stick closer to the syntax in our parser,
but our simplifier will get rid of these variants, having lambda expressions only
take a <em>single</em> parameter, using multiple nested lambdas for multiple parameters.</p>
<h3>Applications</h3>
<p>In the same way that lambda expressions with multiple parameters can be represented
as a sequence of curried lambdas, function application with multiple parameters is
also sugar for curried application. For example:</p>
<pre><code>add 1 2</code></pre>
<p>is syntax sugar for:</p>
<pre><code>(add 1) 2</code></pre>
<p>Our simplifier is going to take care of this as well. In our parser, applications take
multiple parameters, but now we're going to always represent things as:</p>
<pre><code>Apply f e</code></pre>
<p>where <code>f</code> is our function, and <code>e</code> our expression. For multiple parameters, we just use currying:</p>
<pre><code>Apply (Apply add 1) 2</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] <strong>Note:</strong>
I'm using a bit of pseudo-syntax here, but we'll precisely define the structure of our new AST
soon enough.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Builtins</h3>
<p>In real Haskell, you have custom operators, and this entails making operators actually functions.
So something like:</p>
<pre><code>1 + 2 + 3</code></pre>
<p>is actually lingo for:</p>
<pre><code>(+) (((+) 1) 2) 3</code></pre>
<p>(with the specific ordering dependent on the fixity of the operator, of course)</p>
<p>We've opted to instead hardcode the various operators we're going to be using. We'd represent
this same expression as:</p>
<pre><code>BinExpr Add (BinExpr Add 1 2) 3</code></pre>
<p>having simplified the tree a bit.</p>
<p>Instead of using function application, we have a specific syntactical form
for operators. What we want to do in our simplifier is to shift this slightly,
to reuse function application:</p>
<pre><code>Apply (Builtin Add) (Apply (Builtin Add) 1 2) 3</code></pre>
<p>Instead of having a special form for using operators, we now use function application,
and our operators become expression in their own right. We also need to apply currying here,
as mentioned in the previous step.</p>
<p>Doing things this way simplifies the next stages quite a bit. We don't have
this extra kind of expression to deal with. For example, in the typechecker, we just
treat <code>Builtin Add</code> as an expression of type <code>Int -> Int -> Int</code>, as if it were a named
function that happened to be defined.</p>
<p>This is in some sense arriving at the same point Haskell does, where after parsing, operators
become the application of certain functions. The difference is that we've hardcoded certain
functions as existing, and these functions are now <em>builtin</em> to the compiler.</p>
<h2>Multiple Function Heads</h2>
<p>So, there are quite a few things we can simplify about <em>expressions</em>, but we also
have a lot on our plate when it comes to definitions. As mentioned before, the definition
for a given value can be spread out over multiple places:</p>
<pre><code>add :: Int -> Int -> Int
add 0 0 = 0
add n m = n + m</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the definition of <code>add</code> is separated across 3 different elements.
We have one type annotation:</p>
<pre><code>add :: Int -> Int -> Int</code></pre>
<p>one definition using pattern matching:</p>
<pre><code>add 0 0 = 0</code></pre>
<p>and a second definition using pattern matching, but with simple name patterns:</p>
<pre><code>add n m = n + m</code></pre>
<p>Our first order of duty is going to be to somehow unify these three different items
into a <em>single</em> definition. We want each value definition in our program to correspond
to a single item in our simplified tree.</p>
<p>To accomplish this we need to first gather all of the definitions of a value, along with
its type annotation. We can do a few integrity checks here, like making sure that each
definition has the same number of arguments, that multiple type annotations exist, etc.
Then we simplify this collection into a single definition, which requires a couple
of things.</p>
<h3>Creating Functions</h3>
<p>There are multiple ways of defining a function like <code>add</code> above:</p>
<pre><code>add n m = n + m

add n = \n -> n + m

add = \n -> \m -> n + m</code></pre>
<p>All of these are equivalent. The first definition is really syntax sugar for the last
definition. What we want to do is transform functions declaring parameters
like this to bindings of a name to a simple lambda instead.</p>
<h3>Multi Cases</h3>
<p>The last change was pretty simple, but this one is a bit more complicated.
The idea is that in the same way that we transform simple names on the left side
of <code>=</code> into lambdas on the right side, we also need to transform patterns like this:</p>
<pre><code>inc 0 = 1
inc x = x + 1</code></pre>
<p>into lambdas and case expressions:</p>
<pre><code>inc = \$0 -> case $0 of
  0 -> 1
  x -> x = 1</code></pre>
<p>This is straightforward so far, and easy to see. The problem comes with how
functions can match on <em>multiple values</em>. This isn't possible with case expressions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] <strong>Note:</strong>
One solution to this problem is to simply create a case construction allowing
us to match on multiple values at once, punting the problem this poses until
after the type-checker.</p>
<p>I opted against doing this, because by tackling this complexity <em>now</em> it makes the type-checker
simpler as well.</p></blockquote>
<p>For example, take our ongoing example:</p>
<pre><code>add 0 0 = 0
add n m = n + m</code></pre>
<p>If we try and desugar this as we did previously, we have a problem:</p>
<pre><code>add = \$0 -> \$1 -> case ? of</code></pre>
<p>We can't simply move each of the patterns we had previously, since we have no way
matching against both values at the same time. What we need to do is figure
out a way of nesting our case expressions. In this case, there's a pretty
simple solution:</p>
<pre><code>add = \$0 -> \$1 ->
  case $0 of
    0 -> case $1 of
      0 -> 0
      m -> $0 + m
    n -> n + $1</code></pre>
<p>It's not too hard to translate things like this manually. The difficult
comes from doing this <em>automatically</em>. We want to write
an algorithm to perform conversions like this.</p>
<h2>Simplifying Cases</h2>
<p>Another detail we'll be tackling at the same time is removing <em>nested</em>
cases completely. Right now, we can do things like this:</p>
<pre><code>data List a = Cons a (List a) | Nil

drop3 :: List a -> List a
drop3 = \xs -> case xs of
  Cons _ (Cons _ (Cons _ rest)) -> rest
  _ -> Nil</code></pre>
<p>This function drops off 3 elements from the front of a list.
To do this, we need to use <em>multiple</em> nested patterns, in order to
match against the tail of different lists.</p>
<p>In fact, we allow <em>arbitrary</em> patterns to be used inside of a constructor.</p>
<p>We're going to be simplifying case expressions like this, to only
use simple patterns inside of constructors. One way of simplifying
this would be:</p>
<pre><code>drop3 = \xs -> case xs of
  Nil -> Nil
  Cons _ $0 -> case $0 of
    Nil -> Nil
    Cons _ $1 -> case $1 of
      Nil -> Nil
      Cons _ rest -> rest</code></pre>
<p>Once again, we can do this by hand without all that much effort,
but the trickiness comes from being able to do this <em>automatically</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, we'll be felling two birds with one stone here. We'll write an algorithm
that converts multiple nested pattern matching, into single pattern matching
without any nesting. This way, we can tackle the problems of patterns in functions,
and simplifying normal case expressions with the same tool.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] <strong>Note:</strong>
We do this not out of necessity, but because we need to do
this <em>eventually</em>, and getting this out of the way now is convenient,
since we already need to apply a simplification algorithm to our cases,
to remove multiple pattern matching in functions.</p>
<p>Doing this now allows us to simplify the type-checker. Otherwise, we'd
have to do all of this afterwards.</p></blockquote>
<h1>Creating a Stub Simplifier</h1>
<p>As usual for this series, we're going to start by creating a dummy module for our Simplifier,
and integrating it with the rest of the compiler, before coming back and slowly
filling out its various components.</p>
<p>Let's go ahead and add a <code>Simplifier</code> module to our <code>.cabal</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>  exposed-modules:     Ourlude
                     , Lexer
                     , Parser
                     , Simplifier
                     , Types</code></pre>
<p>Next, let's create our actual module in <code>src/Simplifier.hs</code></p>
<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-}
{-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-}
{-# LANGUAGE LambdaCase #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TupleSections #-}

module Simplifier
  ( AST (..),
    SimplifierError (..),
    simplifier,
  )
where

import Ourlude
import qualified Parser as P</code></pre>
<p>We have the standard import for our Prelude, of course,
and a qualified import to be able to easily access everything
in our parser stage. We'll be expanding this with other
imports as necessary.</p>
<p>Except for <code>FlexibleContexts</code>, we've seen all of these extensions before.</p>
<p>We'll be using <code>FlexibleContexts</code> to work with some typeclasses that take
multiple types, namely <code>MonadError</code>. This extension allows us to write constraints like:</p>
<pre><code>doSomething :: MonadError Concrete generic => ...</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we use a concrete type inside of a constraint, which is enabled
by <code>FlexibleContexts</code>.</p>
<p><code>AST</code> is going to be the simplified syntax tree eventually, but we can just create
a stub value for now:</p>
<pre><code>data AST t = AST deriving (Show)</code></pre>
<p>The parameter <code>t</code> will eventually be used to hold the kind
of type stored in the AST. This isn't used right now,
but will be soon enough.</p>
<p>We'll be needing a type for the errors emitted by this stage,
so let's go ahead and create the <code>SimplifierError</code> type as well:</p>
<pre><code>data SimplifierError = NotImplementedYet deriving (Eq, Show)</code></pre>
<p>This is just a stub type for now, indicating that we haven't
implemented this stage yet. We'll be coming back to this
type and actually adding useful errors later.</p>
<p>The last thing we'll be adding for now is our stage function:</p>
<pre><code>simplifier :: P.AST -> Either SimplifierError (AST ())
simplifier _ = Left NotImplementedYet</code></pre>
<p>For now, we just report an error, since we haven't implemented
anything yet. Note how we use <code>AST ()</code> here. This is because
after the simplification stage, we haven't done any type inference,
so we use the type <code>()</code> for the types in our AST. The type-checker
will be filling these slots with something useful, but that's
for the next part.</p>
<h2>Adding a new Stage</h2>
<p>With this stub stage defined, we can go ahead and integrate
it with the rest of our CLI.</p>
<p>Inside of <code>Main.hs</code>, let's import our newly created module:</p>
<pre><code>import qualified Simplifier</code></pre>
<p>Let's now create a stage object for the Simplifier:</p>
<pre><code>simplifierStage :: Stage Parser.AST (Simplifier.AST ())
simplifierStage = makeStage "Simplifier" Simplifier.simplifier</code></pre>
<p>Finally, let's modify <code>readStage</code> to include this stage as
an additional option:</p>
<pre><code>readStage :: String -> Maybe String -> Maybe (String -> IO ())
readStage "lex" _ =
  lexerStage |> printStage |> Just
readStage "parse" _ =
  lexerStage >-> parserStage |> printStage |> Just
readStage "simplify" _ =
  lexerStage >-> parserStage >-> simplifierStage |> printStage |> Just</code></pre>
<p>We can now run this new command in the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>$ cabal run haskell-in-haskell -- simplify foo.hs
Up to date
Simplifier Error:
NotImplementedYet</code></pre>
<p>As expected, we immediately report an error in our simplifier stage.
To fix this, we need to actually implement our simplifier stage!</p>
<h1>Schemes</h1>
<p>Our next goal is to define the kinds of type information that our simplifier
needs to gather from our parsed program. Before we can do that, however,
we need to expand our vocabulary around types a bit more.</p>
<p>At the moment, we have a module for type related data, defined
in <code>src/Types.hs</code>. All of the things we've defined in there so far
were necessary to talk about types <em>syntactically</em>. If we see:</p>
<pre><code>f :: Int -> Int</code></pre>
<p>Then we need a way to talk about the type <code>Int -> Int</code>, in our own compiler.
Concretely, we represent this as <code>IntT :-> IntT</code>, in our <code>Type</code> data structure.</p>
<p>We also included variables, allowing us to talk about polymorphic function
signatures:</p>
<pre><code>id :: a -> a</code></pre>
<p>We'd represent this type signature as:</p>
<pre><code>TVar "a" :-> TVar "a"</code></pre>
<p>The polymorphic variable <code>a</code> is <strong>implicit</strong> in this type signature. We never
declare the variable at all, but (our subset of) Haskell knows that we mean a polymorphic
signature, because the <code>a</code> is lowercase. The signature
<code>A -> A</code> would be quite different, referencing a <em>concrete type</em> <code>A</code>, which would
have to be defined somewhere else.</p>
<p>In actual Haskell, you could instead write <code>id</code>'s signature with an explicit
polymorphic variable:</p>
<pre><code>id :: forall a. a -> a</code></pre>
<p>We don't allow this syntactically, but after the simplifier stage, we'd like to resolve
the implicit polymorphism we have now, and move towards explicitly qualified polymorphism.</p>
<p>We call these kinds of things <strong>schemes</strong> (No relation to algebraic geometry).</p>
<p>We want to be able to represent different signatures, like:</p>
<pre><code>forall a. a -> a
forall a b. a -> b -> b</code></pre>
<p>etc.</p>
<h2>Defining Them</h2>
<p>So, in <code>src/Types.hs</code>, let's go ahead and create a definition for a Scheme:</p>
<pre><code>data Scheme = Scheme [TypeVar] Type deriving (Eq, Show)</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>TypeVar</code> and <code>Type</code> have already been defined by us previously.
We're just saying that a scheme is nothing but some type, referencing a list
of explicitly defined variables.</p>
<p>For example, the signature <code>forall a. a -> a</code> would be represented as:</p>
<pre><code>Scheme ["a"] (TVar "a" :-> TVar "a")</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] <strong>Note:</strong>
Strictly speaking, we could've represented a scheme as a type, quantified
with a <em>set</em> of type variables, instead of a list, as we've done here.</p>
<p>Having a list is slightly more convenient, and more conventional. In practice,
this list is going to be unique, having been created from a set.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Using Them</h2>
<p>We can go ahead and define a few useful operations on Schemes, that we'll
be needing later on. The main operation we'd like to have is one going from an implicit
signature like:</p>
<pre><code>a -> b -> b</code></pre>
<p>into an explicit Scheme:</p>
<pre><code>forall a b. a -> b -> b</code></pre>
<p>All we need to do is make a list of all the different variables appearing in that type
signature. We call the variables that appear unbound in a signature like this "free".
Not only can we look at the free variables in some <em>type</em>, but this concept also makes sense
for schemes. For example, a scheme like:</p>
<pre><code>forall a. a -> b -> b</code></pre>
<p>Only quantifies over <code>a</code>. The variable <code>b</code> is "free" inside of this scheme. At the top level,
this kind of thing doesn't occurr, but we will actually be making use of this
for inferring types <em>inside</em> of definitions, where intermediate definitions can make use of
type variables defined in the outer scope. We'll be seeing all of that in the next part,
when we focus on type-checking. For now, let's just realize that the different
data structures might contain free type variables in one way or another.</p>
<p>Because we have a similar operation across different types, let's create
a class for different things containing free type variables:</p>
<pre><code>import qualified Data.Set as Set
-- ...

class FreeTypeVars a where
  ftv :: a -> Set.Set TypeName</code></pre>
<p>(We need to use the <code>Set</code> data structure, and so need an extra import now)</p>
<p>This class allows us to extract a set containing the names of the free type
variables occurring in an object.</p>
<p>Let's implement this for types:</p>
<pre><code>instance FreeTypeVars Type where
  ftv IntT = Set.empty
  ftv StringT = Set.empty
  ftv BoolT = Set.empty
  ftv (TVar a) = Set.singleton a
  ftv (t1 :-> t2) = ftv t1 <> ftv t2
  ftv (CustomType _ ts) = foldMap ftv ts</code></pre>
<p>For types, since they don't introduce any type variables themselves,
any type variable ocurring inside of a type is free by definition.
This function just has to find the set of type variables contained
inside of this type.</p>
<p>For primitives, they obviously contain no type variables. A type variable
gives us a single set, containing just that variable, and other composite
types have us take the unions of all the variables in each part.
This way, <code>ftv (TVar "a" :-> TVar "b")</code> correctly detects both type variables
contained inside this function signature.</p>
<p>Out of convenience, we can also give an instance for <code>TypeName</code>:</p>
<pre><code>instance FreeTypeVars TypeName where
  ftv = Set.singleton</code></pre>
<p>Seeing a name <code>"a"</code> as lingo for <code>TVar "a"</code>, the free variables occurring
in this "type" are just this one variable.</p>
<p>Things get a bit more interesting for schemes:</p>
<pre><code>instance FreeTypeVars Scheme where
  ftv (Scheme vars t) = Set.difference (ftv t) (Set.fromList vars)</code></pre>
<p>Since a scheme like <code>forall a. a -> b -> b</code> introduces
a type variable <code>a</code>, we need to <em>remove</em> it from all of the variables
that ocurr in the type <code>a -> b -> b</code>, leaving us with just the set <code>{b}</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, it'd be nice to take a set of objects containing type variables,
and get the union of all the variables containing in this big bag.</p>
<p>To do so, let's first add a languag extension at the top of this file:</p>
<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-}</code></pre>
<p>which is required to even declare the following instance:</p>
<pre><code>instance FreeTypeVars a => FreeTypeVars (Set.Set a) where
  ftv = foldMap ftv</code></pre>
<p>Once again, we use the fact that <code><></code> for sets takes the union, allowing
us to take all of the type variables strewn throughout a collection of objects.</p>
<p>With all of this in place, we can go ahead and make the original operation
we wanted to make in this section: making all the variables in some type
explicitly quantified:</p>
<pre><code>closeType :: Type -> Scheme
closeType t = Scheme (ftv t |> Set.toList) t</code></pre>
<p>This takes some type signature, like <code>a -> a</code>, potentially containing
implicit polymorphism, and then explicitly quantifies over all the type
variables occurring in that signature. An obvious application of this is transforming
top level signatures like:</p>
<pre><code>id :: a -> a</code></pre>
<p>into explicit signatures like:</p>
<pre><code>id :: forall a. a -> a</code></pre>
<p>With all of this scheme stuff in place, we can move on to defining
the type information produced by our simplifier.</p>
<h1>Defining Type Information</h1>
<p>As we went over earlier, our simplifier will need to gather information
about the types in our program. Before we write code to do the
actual gathering, let's first define what kind of information we
want to gather in the first place, and write some utilities to
make use of this information.</p>
<p>Now that we're actually doing interesting things
in our simplifier module, let's go ahead and add all the imports
we'll be needing</p>
<pre><code>import Control.Monad (forM_, replicateM, unless, when)
import Control.Monad.Except (Except, MonadError (..), liftEither, runExcept)
import Control.Monad.Reader (MonadReader (..), ReaderT (..), ask, asks, local)
import Control.Monad.State (MonadState, StateT (..), execStateT, get, gets, modify', put)
import Data.Foldable (asum)
import Data.Function (on)
import Data.List (elemIndex, foldl', groupBy, transpose)
import qualified Data.Map as Map
import Data.Maybe (catMaybes)
import qualified Data.Set as Set
import Ourlude
import Parser (ConstructorDefinition (..), ConstructorName, Literal (..), Name, ValName)
import qualified Parser as P
import Types (FreeTypeVars (..), Scheme (..), Type (..), TypeName, TypeVar, closeType)</code></pre>
<p>We have quite a few imports related to different Monad Transformers,
and related utilities. We won't be using these immediately,
but our transformations will be making good use of these transformers
later on.</p>
<p>We need the Map and Set data structures as well, along with a few
related utilities from various modules.</p>
<p>We also import a handful of types directly from our parser,
and then import the rest of the parser module in a qualified way.</p>
<p>Finally, we import most of everything from <code>src/Types.hs</code>,
including the newly defined scheme type.</p>
<h2>Constructor Information</h2>
<p>If a user defines a custom type, like:</p>
<pre><code>data MyType = MyPair Int String | MySingle</code></pre>
<p>We have two constructors, <code>MyPair</code>, and <code>MySingle</code>, and it's nice
to have some information about them available for the later stages.
For example, our type checker needs to know that
each constructor has a given type:</p>
<pre><code>MyPair :: Int -> String -> MyType
MySingle :: MyType</code></pre>
<p>We would also like to assign a "tag" to each constructor of a type.
For example, if we have a simple enum, like:</p>
<pre><code>data Color = Red | Blue | Green</code></pre>
<p>then to distinguish the different variants, we might represent
this type as just an integer, with a different tag for
each variant:</p>
<pre><code>Red = 0
Blue = 1
Green = 2</code></pre>
<p>The way we assign a tag to each variant doesn't matter too much,
as long as each variant gets a different tag.</p>
<p>Let's define a <code>ConstructorInfo</code> type, holding
the information we'd like to know about any given constructor:</p>
<pre><code>data ConstructorInfo = ConstructorInfo
  { constructorArity :: Int,
    constructorType :: Scheme,
    constructorNumber :: Int
  }
  deriving (Eq, Show)</code></pre>
<p>We have a number assigned to each constructor. This number
is different for each constructor, and can serve the purpose
of the "tag" we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>The <code>constructorType</code> field gives us the type of the constructor,
as a function. Note that this is polymorphic, and uses a scheme.
This lets us do polymorphic constructors, like:</p>
<pre><code>data Pair a b = MkPair a b</code></pre>
<p>The <code>MkPair</code> constructor would have as scheme:</p>
<pre><code>forall a b. a -> b -> Pair a b</code></pre>
<p>Finally, the <code>constructorArity</code> field encodes the number
of arguments that a constructor takes. We could derive
this from the type signature of the constructor, by looking
at the number of arguments the function takes, but it's convenient
to be able to access this information directly, having
computed it in advance.</p>
<p>We'd like to gather this information for all of the constructors
in the program, and we need to be able to lookup this information
for any constructor on demand. So, let's define the following
type synonym:</p>
<pre><code>type ConstructorMap = Map.Map ConstructorName ConstructorInfo</code></pre>
<p>This will map each constructor, to the corresponding information
we have about that constructor, using its name.</p>
<h3>Resolving Constructors</h3>
<p>We'll be needing this constructor information not just when
type checking, but later on in the compiler as well. Because
of this, we can make a few generic utilities for contexts
which have access to this constructor information:</p>
<pre><code>class Monad m => HasConstructorMap m where
  constructorMap :: m ConstructorMap</code></pre>
<p>The idea behind this class is that in later stages, where
we have some kind of Monadic context used to perform
some transformation, we might have this constructor information
embedded somewhere in this context, and this class lets us
abstract over that fact.</p>
<p>A convenient utility we can make using this class is
a function letting us check if a given name is a constructor:</p>
<pre><code>isConstructor :: HasConstructorMap m => Name -> m Bool
isConstructor name =
  Map.member name <$> constructorMap</code></pre>
<p>This will be useful in the later STG stage, where we need
to distinguish function application from constructor application.</p>
<p>We'll also be using this information inside of our simplifier.
In this case, what should we do if a constructor that doesn't
exist is referenced? Well, we should catch this error in
our simplifier! Let's add a variant to our <code>SimplifierError</code> type:</p>
<pre><code>data SimplifierError
  = UnknownConstructor ConstructorName
  deriving (Eq, Show)</code></pre>
<p>This error should be raised whenever we encounter a constructor
that doesn't exist, as the name suggests.</p>
<p>Outside of the simplifier, we know that the constructors
present in the program actually exist, so we can make a utility
that looks up a constructor, crashing if this constructor
doesn't exist:</p>
<pre><code>lookupConstructorOrFail ::
  HasConstructorMap m => ConstructorName -> m ConstructorInfo
lookupConstructorOrFail name =
  Map.findWithDefault err name <$> constructorMap
  where
    err = UnknownConstructor name |> show |> error</code></pre>
<p>If this fails after the simplifier stage, then that indicates
an error on <em>our part</em> as a compiler writer, since our simplifier
stage is responsible for making sure that the constructors
used in our program actually exist.</p>
<h2>Synonym Information</h2>
<p>Now, the types contained in each constructor are going to
be <em>resolved</em>, in the sense that all of the type synonyms
that might have appeared in the constructor's signature reference
the most basic type.</p>
<p>So, for example:</p>
<pre><code>data MyType = MkMyType X

type X = Int</code></pre>
<p>The constructor <code>MkMyType</code> would have signature:</p>
<pre><code>Int -> MyType</code></pre>
<p>and not:</p>
<pre><code>X -> MyType</code></pre>
<p>In fact, all of the types that come out of the simplifier
stage will be fully resolved in this fashion.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, we do need to have an internal map
from type names like <code>X</code> to the actual type it references.
So, let's define the following synonym:</p>
<pre><code>type ResolutionMap = Map.Map TypeName ResolvingInformation</code></pre>
<p>For each type name, like <code>X</code>, or <code>MyType</code>, we have some information
about what kind of type that is. Note that primitive types
like <code>Int</code> or <code>Bool</code> are already parsed as <em>syntactically</em> different,
as <code>IntT</code> or <code>BoolT</code>, instead of <code>CustomType "Int" []</code>
and <code>CustomType "Bool" []</code>.</p>
<p>But, what kind of information do we have about each type name?</p>
<p>There are two situations we can have. Either a type is a synonym,
like <code>type X = Int</code>, or it's a full type in its own right,
like <code>MyType</code>. A name might also reference a polymorphic type, like:</p>
<pre><code>data Pair a b = MkPair a b</code></pre>
<p>In this case, when we see the name <code>Pair</code>, we'd like to record
that this is in fact a custom type, and has 2 type parameters.</p>
<p>This gives us the following definition:</p>
<pre><code>data ResolvingInformation
  = Synonym Type
  | Custom Int
  deriving (Eq, Show)</code></pre>
<p><code>Synonym</code> represents the case where some name represents a synonym
for some other type. Note that this is fully resolved, so if we
had something like:</p>
<pre><code>type X = Y
type Y = Int</code></pre>
<p>Then both <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> would resolve to <code>Synonym IntT</code>.</p>
<p>For custom types, we record the number of type arguments that this
type takes. This allow us to tell that <code>Pair Int Int Int</code> is
malformed, because <code>Pair</code> only takes 2 arguments, as a custom type.</p>
<h3>Resolving Types</h3>
<p>Internally, we'd like to use this information, and be able
to turn types referencing synonyms into fully resolved types,
fullfilling our promise of only exporting fully resolved
synonyms from this module.</p>
<p>Before we can do that, let's first add a few more errors
to our error type:</p>
<pre><code>data SimplifierError
  = UnknownType TypeName
  | MismatchedTypeArgs TypeName Int Int
  | ...
  deriving (Eq, Show)</code></pre>
<p><code>UnknownType</code> signals the fact that we've encountered
some type that doesn't exist.</p>
<p><code>MismatchedTypeArgs</code> is raised when we encounter a type
name, with a certain expected number of arguments, that doesn't
match the <em>actual</em> number provided.</p>
<p>With these errors in place, we can write a function to
resolve any type, replacing synonyms with actual types,
provided we have a <code>ResolutionMap</code>:</p>
<pre><code>resolve :: ResolutionMap -> Type -> Either SimplifierError Type
resolve mp = go
  where
    go :: Type -> Either SimplifierError Type
    go = \case
      CustomType name ts -> do
        ts' <- mapM go ts
        let arity = length ts'
        case Map.lookup name mp of
          Nothing -> Left (UnknownType name)
          Just (Synonym _) | arity /= 0 ->
            Left (MismatchedTypeArgs name 0 arity)
          Just (Synonym t) -> return t
          Just (Custom expected) | arity /= expected ->
            Left (MismatchedTypeArgs name expected arity)
          Just (Custom _) -> return (CustomType name ts')
      t1 :-> t2 -> (:->) <$> go t1 <*> go t2
      terminal -> return terminal</code></pre>
<p>(Remember that type synonyms like <code>X</code> will be represented as
<code>CustomType "X" []</code>)</p>
<p>Now, we only have work to do if we have a recursive type
like <code>:-></code>, or if we have a custom type of some kind.
If we have a compound type, we first resolve each of its sub-components.</p>
<p>Then, we lookup the name referenced in the custom type.</p>
<p>If we have no information about the type, then we throw an error.</p>
<p>If it's a synonym, then we make sure that no extra arguments
have been passed. THis is because we don't allow things like:</p>
<pre><code>data MyPair a b = MkPair a b

type P = MyPair</code></pre>
<p>If this is a custom type, we make sure that the number of arguments
matches the number we expect to say.</p>
<h1>Gathering Synonym Information in Theory</h1>
<p>This <code>ResolutionMap</code> would solve all of our problems in terms
of type synonyms, but how do we go about actually <em>creating</em>
this map in the first place?</p>
<p>Let's say we have multiple type synonyms in our program:</p>
<pre><code>type X = Int
type Y = String
type Z = Bool</code></pre>
<p>We want to make a map from each type synonym's name to the actual
type that it corresponds to. A first attempt would be to take
these definitions, and create a simple direct mapping:</p>
<pre><code>X -> Int
Y -> String
Z -> Bool</code></pre>
<p>This happens to work in this case, but this is because our type synonyms
are <em>already</em> fully resolved. It might be the case that our synonyms
reference other synonyms:</p>
<pre><code>type X = Int
type Y = X
type Z = Y</code></pre>
<p>If we make a map with these direct mappings once again, we get the
wrong result:</p>
<pre><code>X -> Int
Y -> X
Z -> Y</code></pre>
<p>We want to make sure that the mappings we have are fully resolved,
so we can't simply leave <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> on the right side there.</p>
<p>In this case, the type synonyms are already presented in a convenient
order. If we go over the program from top to bottom, we can use
the map we've built up so far in order to keep building it.</p>
<p>At first, we have:</p>
<pre><code>X -> Int</code></pre>
<p>Then, we see <code>type Y = X</code>. If we resolve the type <code>X</code>, we get
<code>Int</code>, since that's already in the map, giving us:</p>
<pre><code>X -> Int
Y -> Int</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we can do the same with <code>type Z = Y</code>, having resolved <code>Y</code>,
giving us:</p>
<pre><code>X -> Int
Y -> Int
Z -> Int</code></pre>
<p>This is the fully resolved map that we needed to make in the first place,
so this approach seems promising.</p>
<p>Another difficulty is that the order may not be so convenient.
In fact, it's possible in Haskell to reference type synonyms defined
later on in the file:</p>
<pre><code>type X = Int
type Z = Y
type Y = X</code></pre>
<p>Here no simple top to bottom ordering, or bottom to top ordering
suffices to resolve things. Instead, we need to make use of the
dependencies between different synonyms to make a resolution map.</p>
<h2>Type Synonyms as a Graph</h2>
<p>If we go back to our initial example:</p>
<pre><code>type X = Int
type Y = X
type Z = Y</code></pre>
<p>We can see this setup as a kind of graph, where each type synonym
is connected to the types that it depends on:</p>
<p>
<img src=../Images/ec6a66c6c1be63b25ff12e5f8df231151c661bbbde2d67b5fa84888f8f54f713.png alt= /></p>
<p>This also works if we have a more complicated ordering.
This setup:</p>
<pre><code>type X = Int
type Z = Y
type Y = X</code></pre>
<p>Would be represented as:</p>
<p>
<img src=../Images/4abc3e60c8c72a02f2c93fba61b7230ecbd4792c4c10ecb8dfa867f276a710eb.png alt= /></p>
<p>In both of these graphs, we had a simple linear setup, and it was
clear how to order things to make our map easily. We might have a more
complex dependency setup, however.
Consider the following:</p>
<pre><code>type Z = X

type X = Int

data D = D Z Y

type Y = X</code></pre>
<p>This would lead to the following graph:</p>
<p>
<img src=../Images/3a71d86a6f396fbfc8d966728afddd2a00885cf95f7483c7bb9d218479f857e4.png alt= /></p>
<p>At a first glance, it's not exactly clear what the best order
to resolve things in would be.</p>
<h2>Topological Sort</h2>
<p>Thankfully, other people have actually spent time thinking about this problem,
and there's an elegant solution to the problem. What we've been drawing
each time is a <em>dependency graph</em>. Each type is connected, via arrows,
to all the other types that it depends on, in terms of definitions.
What we'd like to find is a linear ordering of the types that respects
this chain of dependencies.</p>
<p>If we look at the previous graph, then this ordering:</p>
<pre><code>X <- Z <- Y <- D</code></pre>
<p>would respect the dependencies between each type. After finding this order,
we could build up our map of type synonyms in an incremental way,
and never run into a type that we haven't seen before.</p>
<p>Topological sorting is an algorithm that solves our problem exactly.
Given some dependency graph, it finds a linear ordering of the vertices
that satisfies these dependencies. If the graph has a cycle,
this can't work:</p>
<p>
<img src=../Images/b8531f4c6e9bc93d8aecf0b63a02c9d54283daec9c6b01a1eea006440025e848.png alt= /></p>
<p>Thankfully, we can also amend the algorithm to <em>detect</em> these cycles,
and throw an appropriate error. When we see something like:</p>
<pre><code>type X = Y
type Y = X</code></pre>
<p>We need to throw an error, because there's no reasonable way to interpret
what types <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> should be.</p>
<h3>Depth First Search</h3>
<p>The key driver of topological sort is something called
<em>Depth First Search</em>. This is a way of traversing the nodes in a graph,
in a recursive fashion.</p>
<p>Let's say we have some kind of graph:</p>
<p>
<img src=../Images/b1466c4e9127d39fc98ad1d9644b5edd5d9533b50d39c63b09c1f41b5e4d9ff8.png alt= /></p>
<p>We want to visit all of the vertices in a graph, going along the structure
of the graph itself. The idea behind depth first search is that we have
a recursive function, where to search from a vertex, we mark that vertex
as seen, and then recursively search from the vertices directly
connected.</p>
<p>More concretely, here's an illustration of this high level procedure:</p>
<p>
<img src=../Images/28e9f9915fa89f9efe81b1345b5d1ea89bb447870b9cf524cbb906be771209ee.png alt= /></p>
<p>We first mark our vertex as seen, that way we won't visit it again.
Then, for each outgoing edge, we follow it, and then repeat the entire
search procedure starting from there.</p>
<p>In this case, we end up searching the entire graph, but if we haven't,
we can repeat this procedure, picking a random vertex that
we haven't seen yet.</p>
<p>A complete example of this search procedure would look like this.
Every time we see a new vertex, it gets marked in blue, and everytime
we traverse an edge, it also gets marked down.</p>
<p>
<img src=../Images/75e6fa2c948e9bd67a27427930f4f096831c5deada799f109dc84a9d01a21f66.png alt= /></p>
<p>Note that in some cases, we've already seen a vertex, so we don't bother
going down some edge again. This is crucial to avoid wasting work, and
allowing us to stop the search from going on forever.</p>
<h3>Ordering Vertices</h3>
<p>We have a convenient procedure, or at least the <em>idea</em> of a procedure,
for traversing the dependency graph, but how can we use this to generate
an ordering of these vertices?</p>
<p>The key idea is that all of the dependencies need to come <em>before</em>
that vertex.</p>
<p>
<img src=../Images/0388401402abc76fbdf7c01f4c1ee375e094859e4f3b2a2da36f462839459aae.png alt= /></p>
<p>In this example, we'd make sure to output <code>{A, B, C}</code> in
a good order,
as well as <code>Y</code>, before finally outputting <code>X</code>. One way to
implement this rule, is that after recursing on each outgoing edge,
we append the vertex to the list.</p>
<p>Essentially, this gives us the following procedure:</p>
<pre><code>dfs(vertex):
  seen.insert(vertex)
  for v in neighbors(vertex):
    if not seen.contains(v):
      dfs(v)
  emit(vertex)</code></pre>
<p>We can illustrate this ordering on the graph. We circle a vertex
when visited, and mark it when emitted:</p>
<p>
<img src=../Images/96deec8c12f3e4f9c2af60e1fd75599b5d76db5d95bebbf8d705f10c5478c1e1.png alt= /></p>
<p>The final ordering reflects the dependencies in the graph correctly,
because we only emit a vertex after all of is dependents, direct,
or indirect, have been emitted as well.</p>
<p>This yields a linear ordering respecting the dependencies.</p>
<p>Note how <code>Y</code> and <code>A B C</code> are independent, and the exact order
depends on how we traverse the edges. This is fine, since
there are no dependencies between these vertices, if there <em>were</em>,
since DFS always recursively traverses as much as possible, we would
detect that as well.</p>
<h3>Detecting Cycles</h3>
<p>This algorithm works great, except when there's cycles. We can make
a slight amendment to this in order to detect cycles. The idea is
to simply keep track of a list of ancestors, vertices preceding
the current vertex. Then, when visiting a new vertex, we check
that it isn't in this list, otherwise we'd have a cycle:</p>
<p>
<img src=../Images/daf29ae00058cadda9a7d8bc8cef04a8d75327fdaf231eb86607d0782be609ae.png alt= /></p>
<p>When visiting a vertex, we mark it as part of the ancestor set,
until we've finished recursing through all of its outgoing edges.</p>
<p>Well, with that done, we've sketched out the algorithm we'll be
using to resolve all of the type synonyms in our program! If this
isn't all that clear, don't worry too much, since now we get
to actually write the code that implements all of this with
all the necessary detail.</p>
<h1>Gathering Synonyms in practice</h1>
<p>In this next section, we'll be implementing the algorithm we've just
described. Our end goal is to take the top level definitions produced
by our parser, and end up with a <code>ResolutionMap</code>, mapping each
type name to either a fully resolved synonym or a known custom type,
defined by the user.</p>
<p>The process looks something like this:</p>
<ol><li>First, gather all of the type synonyms</li><li>Sort them, according to the dependency graph</li><li>Construct the resolutions synonym by synonym, using the partially
constructed map</li></ol>
<p>Let's go ahead and get the sorting out of the way, as that's
somewhat fresh in our mind, and abstracted from the other two steps.</p>
<h2>New Errors</h2>
<p>First things first, let's add an extra error variant to <code>SimplifierError</code>:</p>
<pre><code>data SimplifierError
  = CyclicalTypeSynonym TypeName [TypeName]
  | ...
  deriving (Eq, Show)</code></pre>
<p>This error will get thrown if we find a cycle while traversing
the graph of type synonyms. We have the type we detected the error at,
and a list of ancestors preceding that synonym, making up the cycle.</p>
<h2>Sorting Context</h2>
<p>Our depth first search algorithm will need to keep track of different
pieces of state, as we traverse the graph. We need to keep a set of
vertices that we've seen so far, crucial to our algorithm. We'll also
be emitting vertices as we do our traversal, so we can keep a list as
our "output buffer".</p>
<p>This gives us the following state for our sorter:</p>
<pre><code>data SorterState = SorterState
  { unseen :: Set.Set TypeName,
    output :: [TypeName]
  }</code></pre>
<p><code>unseen</code> keeps track of a set of vertices that we <em>have not seen yet</em>.
This is more convenient, since it serves both the purpose of the
seen set, as well as letting us pick the next vertex to visit,
if we run out of neighbors.</p>
<p>The <code>output</code> list lets us emit vertices as we do our traversal,
by putting them to the front of the list. We'll need to reverse the list
after we're finished, of course. Doing it this way is much more efficient
than constantly appending to the end of the list.</p>
<p>Inside of our DFS algorithm, we'll need to be able to modify this state,
so we want a monadic context for the sorting algorithm:</p>
<pre><code>type SorterM a =
  ReaderT (Set.Set TypeName)
  (StateT SorterState
  (Except SimplifierError) a)</code></pre>
<p>We have a stateful component for the <code>SorterState</code> type we've just defined,
allowing us to modify the state as we traverse the graph.
We'll be needing to raise errors, namely if we detect a cycle,
so we have a layer for errors with <code>Except</code> as well. We also
keep a set of ancestors around, in order to detect cycles.</p>
<p>We could put this information inside of the <code>SorterState</code>, adding
and removing ancestors as we start traversing different subgraphs.
Using a Reader here lets us temporarily replace the environment
before traversing a subgraph, with this change automatically being
undone after that recursive call ends. This is more convenient,
and a trick we'll be employing in other stages of the compiler as well.</p>
<p>As usual with monadic contexts, we have a function to run this computation:</p>
<pre><code>runSorter :: SorterM a -> SorterState -> Either SimplifierError a
runSorter m st =
  runReaderT m Set.empty |> (`runStateT` st) |> runExcept |> fmap fst</code></pre>
<p>To run this computation, we just need an initial state to pass in,
and we get a value or an error out. This works by passing in an
empty set of ancestors, which is the right starting state for our search.</p>
<h2>Type Dependencies</h2>
<p>We've been talking a lot about the "graph" of dependencies. But we don't
actually have a concrete graph lying around. Instead, we look up
the dependencies of a type on demand, giving us an implicit graph.</p>
<p>Calculating the dependencies of a type is pretty straightforward:</p>
<pre><code>typeDependencies :: Type -> Set.Set TypeName
typeDependencies = \case
  t1 :-> t2 ->
    typeDependencies t1 <> typeDependencies t2
  CustomType name exprs ->
    Set.singleton name <> foldMap typeDependencies exprs
  _ -> mempty</code></pre>
<p>We have a dependency if we refer to some name anywhere in the type,
so we recurse and join together all of the different names referenced
in this type.</p>
<p>For example, if we have:</p>
<pre><code>X -> Y</code></pre>
<p>Then <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are dependencies of this type.</p>
<p>This also works in nested situations:</p>
<pre><code>List X -> String</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>List</code> and <code>X</code> are dependencies of this function type.</p>
<h2>Core Algorithm</h2>
<p>With all of these little pieces on place, we can finally start working
on the actual sorting algorithm:</p>
<pre><code>sortTypeSynonyms ::
  Map.Map TypeName Type -> Either SimplifierError [TypeName]
sortTypeSynonyms mp =
  runSorter sort (SorterState (Map.keysSet mp) []) |> fmap reverse
  where
    sort :: SorterM [TypeName]
    ...</code></pre>
<p>Given a mapping of different type names to actual types, we return
a sorted list of type names, that can then be resolved one after the other.
Note that we reverse the final list, because our algorithm "appends"
to its buffer by putting things at the front of the list.</p>
<p>At the start, we haven't outputted anything, and all of the type names,
the keys in this map, are unseen.</p>
<h3>Primitive Operations</h3>
<p>A first helper we can make is a function to give us all of the dependencies
of a given type name:</p>
<pre><code>  where
    ...
    deps :: TypeName -> Set.Set TypeName
    deps k = Map.findWithDefault Set.empty k (Map.map typeDependencies mp)</code></pre>
<p>Basically, we know how to get the dependencies of a given type,
so to get the dependencies of a <em>name</em>, we need to lookup that name in
our map of types, returning no dependencies if that name isn't present.</p>
<p>Another simple operation lets us output a name that we want to add
to our output list:</p>
<pre><code>  where
    ...
    out :: TypeName -> SorterM ()
    out name = modify' (\s -> s {output = name : output s})</code></pre>
<p>As mentioned previously, we add a name to the output by prepending
it to the list, which is very efficient. This is why we have to reverse
the list at the end of the algorithm.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] <strong>Note:</strong>
We use <code>modify'</code> here to avoid creating a lazy thunk when updating
the state.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another operation is modifying a computation to run with an
extra ancestor:</p>
<pre><code>  where
    ...
    withAncestor :: TypeName -> SorterM a -> SorterM a
    withAncestor = local <<< Set.insert</code></pre>
<p>This will modify the computation passed in to run with an additional
type name as an ancestor. This is more convenient then having to manully
insert the name, run the computation, and remove the name.</p>
<p>Finally, the key operation in DFS is adding a vertex to the seen set,
making sure that we don't visit it again:</p>
<pre><code>  where
    ...
    see :: TypeName -> SorterM Bool
    see name = do
      unseen' <- gets unseen
      modify' (\s -> s {unseen = Set.delete name unseen'})
      return (Set.member name unseen')</code></pre>
<p>This also returns whether or not this vertex has been seen before,
which will be useful for our algorithm.</p>
<h3>DFS</h3>
<p>With all of these little helpers in place, we can get to the actual DFS
algorithm:</p>
<pre><code>  where
    ...
    dfs :: TypeName -> SorterM ()
    dfs name = do
      ancestors <- ask
      when
        (Set.member name ancestors)
        (throwError (CyclicalTypeSynonym name (Set.toList ancestors)))
      new <- see name
      when new <| do
        withAncestor name (forM_ (deps name) dfs)
        out name</code></pre>
<p>This function continues searching from a given name, representing
a vertex in the graph.</p>
<p>First we check that this vertex doesn't appear as one of its ancestors,
otherwise we have a cycle.</p>
<p>Then, we report this vertex as seen. If we hadn't seen this vertex before,
then we recursively search all of its dependencies, with
this vertex marked as an ancestor. Finally, we add this vertex to
our sorted list.</p>
<p>Now, to actually implement <code>sort</code>, we need to run this DFS process
multiple times, each time picking a vertex we haven't seen before:</p>
<pre><code>  where
    ...
    sort :: SorterM [TypeName]
    sort = do
      unseen' <- gets unseen
      case Set.lookupMin unseen' of
        Nothing -> gets output
        Just n -> do
          dfs n
          sort</code></pre>
<p>When we've seen all the vertices, we return the output list we've
been building up.</p>
<p>And with that, we now have our algorithm to sort the type synonyms
in our program, given the implicit dependency graph.
Our next order of business is tying up a few loose ends in our resolving
of type information.</p>
<h2>Making the resolution map</h2>
<p>Now we need to actually make the resolution map. The idea, as
we mentioned before, is to gather all the information about
the different types, then sort them into an order
letting us build up the map step by step.</p>
<p>First, we need to gather all of the custom types:</p>
<pre><code>gatherCustomTypes :: [P.Definition] -> Map.Map TypeName Int
gatherCustomTypes =
  foldMap <| \case
    P.DataDefinition name vars _ -> Map.singleton name (length vars)
    _ -> Map.empty</code></pre>
<p>This is a straightforward accumulation, where we end up with a
map from name to arity for each custom type.</p>
<p>We can do a similar thing with type synonyms:</p>
<pre><code>gatherTypeSynonyms :: [P.Definition] -> Map.Map TypeName Type
gatherTypeSynonyms =
  foldMap <| \case
    P.TypeSynonym name expr -> Map.singleton name expr
    _ -> Map.empty</code></pre>
<p>The final result will map each type synonym's name to the type
it was declared to be a synonym of. Note that this isn't resolved
yet, since type synonyms can reference other synonyms.</p>
<p>When making our resolution map, we have two bits of information
we're working on. After getting a sorted list of type names,
giving us an order to fill in our resolution map with, we still
need to keep our original mapping of synonym names to synonym
types. We also need to keep our <code>ResolutionMap</code>, in a stateful
way, since we want to build it up progressively. This context
will also need to report errors, as usual.</p>
<p>This gives us the following definition for the context:</p>
<pre><code>type MakeResolutionM a =
  ReaderT (Map.Map TypeName Type)
  (StateT ResolutionMap
  (Except SimplifierError)) a</code></pre>
<p>Running this context is pretty simple:</p>
<pre><code>runResolutionM ::
  MakeResolutionM a ->
  Map.Map TypeName Type ->
  ResolutionMap ->
  Either SimplifierError ResolutionMap
runResolutionM m typeSynMap st =
  runReaderT m typeSynMap |> (`execStateT` st) |> runExcept</code></pre>
<p>To run the context, we need to prove a map from type names,
to unresolved types (the synonyms we want to resolve) as well as
an initial resolution map. We don't always pass in an empty map
here, since initially, we actually know about all of the custom types.</p>
<p>With this context in place, if we have a correct ordering
of type synonym names, we can build up this resolution map of ours:</p>
<pre><code>resolveAll :: [TypeName] -> MakeResolutionM ()
resolveAll =
  mapM_ <| \n ->
    asks (Map.lookup n) >>= \case
      Nothing -> throwError (UnknownType n)
      Just unresolved -> do
        resolutions' <- get
        resolved <- liftEither (resolve resolutions' unresolved)
        modify' (Map.insert n (Synonym resolved))</code></pre>
<p>For each type synonym name, we look up the unresolved type
this synonym was declared as. An error should be reported if
no such type can be found. Otherwise, we use the handy
<code>resolve</code> function we defined earlier, which resolves the type
given the resolution map we've built up so far. Because we've
sorted the names based on dependencies, this will always be able
to resolve the type. We then insert this synonym as an entry
into our resolution map.</p>
<p>We can integrate all of this into a little function that gathers
up the resolution map from the top level definitions in the program:</p>
<pre><code>gatherResolutions ::
  [P.Definition] -> Either SimplifierError ResolutionMap
gatherResolutions defs = do
  let customInfo = gatherCustomTypes defs
      typeSynMap = gatherTypeSynonyms defs
  names <- sortTypeSynonyms typeSynMap
  runResolutionM
    (resolveAll names)
    typeSynMap
    (Map.map Custom customInfo)</code></pre>
<p>We gather the type synonyms, and custom types, using the top level
definitions. Our initial resolution map already includes
all of these custom types. We need to sort all of the type
synonym names first, to make sure that our resolution works out,
as we've gone over a few times now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] <strong>Note:</strong>
We're not resolving the inside of the custom types just yet,
our resolution map only cares that a custom type exists,
and has a certain arity. We don't need to know about the constructors
here.</p></blockquote>
