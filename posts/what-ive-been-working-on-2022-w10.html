<p>A toy blockchain in Haskell, simulation-based security, and tinkering
on Cryptographic foundations.</p><!--more-->
<h1>Omocha</h1>
<p>The main programming project I've been working on is a "toy" blockchain,
written in Haskell. I'm calling it <a href=https://github.com/cronokirby/omocha>omocha</a>,
which is Japanese for <em>toy</em>.</p>
<p>I say "toy", in the sense that I'm not intending it to be used seriously.
Rather, the purpose of the project is mainly to write a minimum viable example
of a blockchain, implementing all the necessary components from scratch,
albeit to a standard below production-level. The point is to spend more time
learning novel aspects of how these systems work, rather than optimizing
them using techniques I already know.</p>
<p>My goal here is to eventually have a simple Proof-of-Work blockchain,
similar to Bitcoin. One thing I'm curious to learn about is the underlying
structure of the Peer-to-Peer architecture underpinning everything. You
hear a lot of talk about the Cryptography in Cryptocurrency, but less
and less about the underlying P2P communication layer. For example,
when you create a transaction, and broadcast it to miners, how do you
actually go about doing this broadcast? How do nodes receive the data
in a block when it gets mined? How do nodes handle reorganizations of
the chain? These are the kinds of questions I hope to get answers to.
Ultimately, I'll have to figure out some solution to these questions,
at least if I want to implement the project.</p>
<p>I've wanted to do a project in Haskell for a while, so this was a good occasion
to pick it back up. I had initially planned on doing Rust, but then I started
looking at how to interoperate between Rust and Haskell, and caught a bit
of a brain parasite convincing me to try mixing the two to create
this fun little project.</p>
<p>I'm still using Rust for the Cryptography though. For example, I use
a <a href=https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Schnorr_signature>Schnorr signature</a> scheme over <a href=https://ristretto.group/what_is_ristretto.html>Ristretto</a>,
and I implemented that in Rust. To access it through Haskell, I went through
Haskell's FFI.</p>
<p>Haskell's FFI has very few types, and is mainly designed around C.
The only useful things we can pass around are <code>int</code> and <code>*</code>. Because
of this, you have to contort the Rust API a little bit. And because you're
working in Rust, and not C, you also have to do a little massaging at that layer
as well:</p>
<p>
<img src=../Images/90d7b00820b48998217f0375f3f4f411bde1ad133a037a36ee9d5e1153e26517.png alt= /></p>
<p>When you'd want to have a <code>ByteString</code> in Haskell, that becomes a function
that takes a pointer, and writes to it:</p>
<pre><code>foreign import ccall unsafe "signature_generate_private_key"
  c_signature_generate_private_key :: Ptr Word8 -> IO ()</code></pre>
<p>There's a convenient function <a href=https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring-0.11.3.0/docs/Data-ByteString-Internal.html#v:create><code>create</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>create :: Int -> (Ptr Word8 -> IO ()) -> IO ByteString</code></pre>
<p>Which lets you then use this initialization function in order
to create a <code>ByteString</code> on the Haskell side.</p>
<p>So, passing around bytes is somewhat easy.</p>
<p>What's more difficult is passing around a more complicated structure.</p>
<p>The public keys for my scheme are a point on the Ristretto curve, which
is a complicated Rust struct. Now, I could represent public keys as just
the compressed bytes of this point, but I like the idea of parsing
the bytes into a valid public key on the Haskell side, rather than
having signatures potentially fail to verify because the public key is bad.
This kind of API feels more Haskelly to me.</p>
<p>To pass this thing around, the simplest way I found was to use an opaque
representation. Basically, on the Rust side, we have:</p>
<pre><code>#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn signature_private_key_to_public_key(
    private_ptr: *const u8,
) -> Box<signature::PublicKey> {
    Box::new(unsafe { signature::PrivateKey::from_pointer(private_ptr) }.public_key())
}</code></pre>
<p>Which we can sort of think of as Rust using <code>malloc</code> to create space
for this object, and then passing the pointer over to Haskell land.
Our intention is to pass ownership of this object from the Rust side
to the Haskell side:</p>
<p>
<img src=../Images/d48e611f523262dc58d53e8ffdc3ea7a66ecfdf7a40ea20cd2f6ac1cf571c351.png alt= /></p>
<p>This also means that the Haskell side is responsible for freeing that memory
itself. We do this by attaching a finalizer to that object, using
the <code>ForeignPtr</code> type. This finalizer needs to be something like
C's <code>free</code>. In Rust, we can actually "free" the memory in the Box using
Rust's automatic memory management:</p>
<pre><code>#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn signature_free_public_key(_: Box<signature::PublicKey>) {}</code></pre>
<p>By taking back ownership of the <code>Box</code>, the Rust side will automatically
free the memory too.</p>
<p>In total, the Haskell looks like:</p>
<pre><code>foreign import ccall unsafe "signature_private_key_to_public_key"
  c_signature_private_key_to_public_key :: Ptr Word8 -> IO (Ptr CPublicKey)

foreign import ccall unsafe "&signature_free_public_key"
  c_signature_free_public_key :: FinalizerPtr CPublicKey

privateToPublic :: PrivateKey -> PublicKey
privateToPublic priv = privToPubIO priv |> unsafePerformIO |> PublicKey
  where
    privToPubIO :: PrivateKey -> IO (ForeignPtr CPublicKey)
    privToPubIO (PrivateKey privBS) =
      unsafeUseAsCStringLen privBS
        <| \(privPtr, _) -> do
          pubPtr <- c_signature_private_key_to_public_key (castPtr privPtr)
          newForeignPtr c_signature_free_public_key pubPtr</code></pre>
<p>And you have more and more plumbing for all the other functions.</p>
<p>Is this tedious? Yes. Is it fun? Also, yes. So far, I don't regret writing
the Cryptography in Rust, and I think it will scale easily to the rest
of the project. It's probably a good way to bring good Cryptography
to the Haskell ecosystem too. I'm very bullish on the future of Rust
as a solid foundation for Cryptographic implementations.</p>
<h1>Simulation based Security</h1>
<p>I don't really have anything interesting to say about this for now,
other than that I've been reading Yehuda Lindell's <a href=https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/046.pdf>How To Simulate It</a>
paper, which goes over this technique for proving security. I think I've
grokked most of the technique, but I need to go over practical applications
of it, like for Threshold ECDSA protocols, and see more examples of how to actually
prove things secure.</p>
<p>When I was learning game based security 6 or so months ago, it took a lot
of examples and "street fighting" using the methodology before I was really
comfortable with it. The abstractions we create are relatively crude
approximations of the intuitive interactions and properties we try
to capture with them, so the interplay between the intuition of what
a proof is, and the mechanics of what the syntax we write actually
means can get quite subtle.</p>
<p>I have <a href=https://securecomputation.org/>Pragmatic MPC</a> on my reading list,
so that will probably be my next encounter with street fighting using
simulation based security.</p>
<h1>Cryptographic Foundations</h1>
<p>I wrote <a href=/notes/2022/on-formalizing-security-games/>a post</a>
<a href=/notes/2022/some-more-notes-on-security-games/>or two</a> tinkering
around with a more categorical formulation of basic security games,
and I've been pretty happy with the results so far. I've been taking
Serge Vaudenay's "Advanced Cryptography" course this semester, which goes
into the basics of security games (roughly, a subset of what's in <a href=https://toc.cryptobook.us/>Boneh and Shoup's book</a>),
and it's been interesting comparing my formalization with the one he uses,
as well as trying to reframe the examples we've encountered in class with
my own.</p>
<p>I've had to make a few adjustments this week accordingly. One idea I've
been toying around with is to simply define the state and message types
indexed over <span class="katex-wrapper"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{N}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6889em;"></span><span class="mord mathbb">N</span></span></span></span></span> directly, rather than stopping at some arbitrary <span class="katex-wrapper"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.109em;">N</span></span></span></span></span>.
You can encode standard situations like "The adversary makes at most <span class="katex-wrapper"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>Q</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Q</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8778em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">Q</span></span></span></span></span> queries"
by simply setting all the states and messages after a certain point to be trivial.
i.e. the adversary has to send empty messages, receives empty responses,
and the state of the challenger doesn't change. This avoids the issue
of havint his arbitrary size "N" in your formalization of what a game is.</p>
<p>Another little problem with my formalization is that when doing reductions,
I only allowed sending one "message" to the adversary you're using,
before having to send another message back to the challenger. This is awkward
for many reductions, but not an essential problem. One way around this
is to allow all challengers to accept a "I'm not ready to respond yet"
message in place of whatever they would have liked to receive, in which
case they reply with something trivial in response. This allows querying
your own adversary multiple times before responding back to the challenger
with something interesting. You can also modify the reduction framework
to explicitly allow a polynomial number of interactions with your own
adversary before moving back to the challenger. This is why having
an "unlimited" number of states indexed by <span class="katex-wrapper"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{N}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6889em;"></span><span class="mord mathbb">N</span></span></span></span></span> is more convenient
too.</p>
<p>But all of these is just hand-wavy speculation, I should really get around
to making this more concrete, and see what problems end up arising.</p>
<p>Another interesting result I found relates to the product of ciphers.
I had defined what the product <span class="katex-wrapper"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>×</mo><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A \times B</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.7667em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span><span class="mbin">×</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.0502em;">B</span></span></span></span></span> and coproduct

<p>I should really write this up more formally, in my notes. I should
also get to actually formalizing all of these more concretely,
my notes are a bit hand-wavy at the moment. A blog post would
be warranted to explain all of this too, but I'd rather get this stuff
out there than not.</p>
<p>I'm pretty happy with this little result, and I think this might be the
first little success with my experiment.</p><section class="footnotes">
