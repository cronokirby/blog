<p>This is the second post in the <a href=/series/haskell-in-haskell>Haskell in Haskell</a> series.</p>
<p>In this post, we'll go over creating a <em>lexer</em> for our subset of Haskell. This stage
of the compiler goes from the raw characters in our a source file, to a more
structured stream of <em>tokens</em>.</p>
<p>We'll finally be digging into some serious code this time, so get your editor
ready if you're following along!</p><!--more-->
<p>The full code for this part is available
<a href=https://github.com/cronokirby/haskell-in-haskell/tree/part-2>here</a>,
for reference.</p>
<h1>1 mile overview</h1>
<p>Before we go dive into the code, let's first get an idea of
what this part is about. What job
is the lexing phase trying to accomplish? What is it responsible for?
What kind of output will we produce?</p>
<h2>Making Tokens</h2>
<p>The first goal of the lexer is to take our raw source code,
a blob of characters (<code>String</code>, in Haskell),
and figure out how to group these characters to make the Parser's job
easier.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Parser is going to take our tokens, and then produce
a complete representation of the source code.
The Parser <em>could</em> work directly on characters, but this would
be more complicated. We would be worrying about character level
concerns, at the same time as higher level structure.
Having a separate lexing phase
gives us a nice separation of concerns here.</p>
<p>The Parser will need to use context to do its job.
For example, when parsing an expression, it knows not to try
and read out things related to types. On the other hand,
the lexer (at least the part that spits out tokens) can
be made to work <em>without</em> context.</p>
<p>The lexer just reads in characters, and spits out tokens. After spitting
out a token, the lexer is in the exact same "state" that it started with.
The lexer has minimal knowledge about context.</p>
<h2>What tokens?</h2>
<p>So far we've talked about "tokens", or "clusters". A good analogy is that
our source code is like a sentence in English: the sentence is composed
of raw characters, ditto for source code. The words in the sentence make
up the <em>tokens</em> in our source code. And finally, the parse tree gives us
the meaning of the sentence, or the source code.</p>
<p>So, we want to split up our source code into the tokens that compose it.
What kind of tokens will we end up using?</p>
<p>As an example, consider this simple definition:</p>
<pre><code>myDefinition = 232 + y2</code></pre>
<p>In terms of raw characters, we have:</p>
<pre><code>m y D e f i n i t i o n  =  2 3 2  +  y  2</code></pre>
<p>In terms of tokens, we'd like to end up with:</p>
<p>
<img src=../Images/6cae58b6e9e66d43451e056f2f4bbe722e277497f494724ec9ee1cb4d8f6689e.png alt= /></p>
<p>Here, we've first separated out an <em>identifier</em>, that must be taken as a whole.
It makes no sense to process <code>myDefinition</code> as anything but a single unit
in the parser. We also have two operators, <code>=</code>, and <code>+</code>. We also have a <em>literal</em>, <code>232</code>. It
doesn't make sense to treat a literal as anything but a unit.</p>
<p>We'll be going over the details of what tokens we'd like to define, and how
exactly we're going to go about lexing them out of our source code later.
But keep this idea in mind: we're trying to separate out our source
code into little <em>units</em>, all to make our Parser much simpler.</p>
<h2>Generating Whitespace</h2>
<p>Our lexer will also have a job much more specific to Haskell.
Haskell has one critical feature that makes parsing it a bit tricky:
whitespace.</p>
<p>We're quite used to the whitespace sensitivity as Haskell programmers. Most
programming languages nowadays don't even require semicolons, even
if they do still use braces for layout. On the other hand,
most people don't know how Haskell actually uses braces and semicolons out of the hood.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<pre><code>let { x = 2; y = 3 } in x + y</code></pre>
<p>Is a perfectly valid expression.
However, most people would write this as:</p>
<pre><code>let x = 2
    y = 3
in x + y</code></pre>
<p>and they may not even be <em>aware</em> that you could use the braces and semicolons instead.
In fact, not only is the braced version an <em>option</em>, but the whitespaced
version is nothing more than <em>syntax sugar</em> for this way of doing things.</p>
<p>When Haskell sees:</p>
<pre><code>let x = 2
    y = 3
in x + y</code></pre>
<p>It understands that you <em>really</em> mean:</p>
<pre><code>let {
  x = 2;
  y = 3
}
in x + y</code></pre>
<p>and infers those pesky braces and semicolons accordingly.</p>
<p>In fact, when you have multiple definitions at the top level, like:</p>
<pre><code>x = 2
y = 3
z = 4</code></pre>
<p>This is also <em>lingo</em> for a braced version:</p>
<pre><code>{
x = 2;
y = 3;
z = 4
}</code></pre>
<p>What we're going
to be doing is adding an extra <em>mini-stage</em> that
looks at the whitespace in our program, and inserts
the correct semicolons and braces to reflect the meaning of the
indentation.</p>
<p>We could do this as part of the parser, but this would make the parser <em>much more complicated</em>
than it otherwise needs to be. Doing this as an extra step between the more traditional
lexer and the parser makes things much cleaner, and much more maintainable.</p>
<p>If you don't understand exactly what constructs end up using
indentation to insert braces and semicolons, that's normal: I haven't explained it yet :).
We'll be going over this whole business in much more detail when we
<em>implement</em> this system, so that it's fresh in our heads.</p>
<h1>Our First Stage</h1>
<p>So, having seen what we're going to be accomplishing
in this part, let's actually start the scaffolding for what we want to do.</p>
<h2>A trivial Lexer</h2>
<p>The first thing we want to do is to create a trivial lexer. This will
serve as a stubholder for now. Our goal here is to write the command line
wrapper around this code first, and then expand it to make an actual
lexer later.</p>
<p>Anyhow, we need a <code>Lexer</code> module, so let's add that to our <code>exposed-modules</code>
in our <code>.cabal</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>library
  ...
  exposed-modules: Ourlude
                 , Lexer
  ...</code></pre>
<p>And then, let's create a file for this module, in <code>src/Lexer.hs</code>:</p>
<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE LambdaCase #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TupleSections #-}
module Lexer (Token(..), lexer) where

import Ourlude</code></pre>
<p>We're using two <em>extensions</em> here to add some extra features to the code in this module.</p>
<p>The first <a href=https://typeclasses.com/ghc/lambda-case>LambdaCase</a>, allows us to
replace expressions like:</p>
<pre><code>\x -> case x of
  Foo -> ...
  Bar -> ...</code></pre>
<p>with:</p>
<pre><code>\case
  Foo -> ...
  Bar -> ...</code></pre>
<p>which explains the naming of this feature.</p>
<p>The second, <a href=https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/school/to-infinity-and-beyond/pick-of-the-week/guide-to-ghc-extensions/basic-syntax-extensions#tuplesections>TupleSections</a>
allows us to use partially apply <em>tuples</em>, in the same way you can do operators.
For example, you can do:</p>
<pre><code>map (,3) ["A", "B"]
[("A", 3), ("B", 3)]</code></pre>
<p>Without the extension, you'd have to write the less terse: <code>\x -> (x, 3)</code> instead.</p>
<p>Both of these extensions are included in this module because they simplify some code here
and there. <code>LambdaCase</code>, in particular, will even be used pretty heavily throughout
the project.</p>
<p>We also have <code>import Ourlude</code>, in order to import the custom prelude
we defined <a href=/posts/2020/11/haskell-in-haskell-1/>last time</a>.</p>
<p>For now, let's create a "stub" implementation of our lexer:</p>
<pre><code>data LexerError = UnimplementedError deriving (Eq, Show)

data Token = NoTokensYet deriving (Eq, Show)

lexer :: String -> Either LexerError [Token]
lexer _ = Left UnimplementedError</code></pre>
<p>These are the types that our lexer will eventually end up producing. Given a string,
containing the source code we need to lex, we should either produce an
error, of type <code>LexerError</code>, or the list of tokens we managed to lex.</p>
<p>Right now, we just have a dummy token type, and an error indicating that our lexer
has not been implemented yet.</p>
<h2>Making a CLI program</h2>
<p>Before we actually implement these functions, we're first going to integrate the
lexer into our command line program, so that the user can run it on an actual file.
We can reuse this boilerplate for the other stages
of our compiler as well. With this out of the way now, we can focus on the guts
of the compiler as we move forward.</p>
<p>First, let's add the imports we'll be needing in <code>Main.hs</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import Control.Monad ((>=>))
import Data.Char (toLower)
import qualified Lexer
import Ourlude
import System.Environment (getArgs)
import System.Exit (exitFailure)
import Text.Pretty.Simple (pPrint, pPrintString)</code></pre>
<p>We import our <code>Lexer</code> module, since we'll be using that here.
We also import our prelude, of course, as well as some small helpers like <code>>=></code>, and <code>toLower</code>.
We have some IO stuff we'll be using like <code>getArgs :: IO [String]</code> for getting the arguments passed
to our program, as well as <code>exitFailure :: IO ()</code>, to quit the program if an error happens.</p>
<p><code>pPrint</code> and <code>pPrintString</code> come from
the library we mentioned
<a href=/posts/2020/11/haskell-in-haskell-1/>last time</a>
, which can format any given string in a nice way.</p>
<h3>Stages: The Idea</h3>
<p>We're going to make a bit an abstraction over the concept of a <em>stage</em>.
Our compiler will be composed of various stages, such as the lexer,
the parser, etc. Each stage takes in some input, and produces some output,
potentially failing with an error. Our lexer takes in a <code>String</code> as input,
produces <code>[Token]</code> as output, and fails with <code>LexerError</code>. Our stage
abstraction should represent this concept of input, output, and errors.</p>
<p>We also want to be able to produce some kind
of function, or <code>IO</code> procedure to execute, knowing up to which stage we want
to proceed. So if the user does <code>haskell-in-haskell lex foo.hs</code>, we know that
they want to stop and see the output of the lexing stage, whereas <code>haskell-in-haskell type foo.hs</code>
would mean stopping after the type-checking phase, etc.
We need to use our stage abstraction to construct some kind of <code>IO</code> action,
and figure out which of these actions to run based on this first argument. So if we see <code>lex</code>,
we run <code>lexAction</code>, if we see <code>type</code> we run <code>typeAction</code>, etc.</p>
<h3>Stages: The Implementation</h3>
<p>The first thing we need is some kind of opaque error type. We want this so that our
stage abstraction doesn't have to keep track of the error type, for one, and also
so that we can annotate the errors produced by that stage with some metadata, like
the name of that stage.</p>
<p>So, in <code>Main.hs</code>, let's create:</p>
<pre><code>data StagedError = StagedError String String</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, the two arguments are easily confused,
but
the first will be the name of the stage, and the second will be the
error produced by a given stage, already converted to a <code>String</code>.</p>
<p>We want to be able to transform <code>Either ThisStageError ThisStageInput</code> to use this
error convention, so let's create:</p>
<pre><code>stageEither :: Show e => String -> Either e a -> Either StagedError a
stageEither name m = case m of
  Left e -> Left (StagedError name (show e))
  Right a -> Right a</code></pre>
<p>Given a name (which is presumably that of a given stage), we can massage the
error into a <code>StagedError</code> by showing the error,
and putting the name beside it.</p>
<p>We want to be able to print this <code>StagedError</code> type in
a nice way, so let's create:</p>
<pre><code>printStagedError :: StagedError -> IO ()
printStagedError (StagedError name err) = do
  putStr name
  putStrLn " Error:"
  pPrintString err</code></pre>
<p>This uses <code>pPrintString</code> from the <code>pretty-simple</code> library
to print out the error in a nice way.</p>
<p>With this error type in hand, we can create our stage abstraction:</p>
<pre><code>data Stage i o = Stage
  { name :: String,
    runStage :: i -> Either StagedError o
  }</code></pre>
<p>So, <code>Stage</code> is parameterized over an input type <code>i</code>, and an output type <code>o</code>.
We use this to create a function taking input <code>i</code>, and producing output <code>o</code>,
potentially failing with a <code>StagedError</code>. We also have the name of the stage
as an extra bit of metadata.</p>
<p>We might have <code>Stage String [Token]</code> for our Lexer, <code>Stage [Token] SyntaxTree</code> for our
Parser, etc.</p>
<p>Our lexer is of the form <code>String -> Either LexerError [Token]</code>. If we squint at this a bit,
we see <code>i -> Either e o</code>. We want to transform these kinds of function into <code>Stage</code>, so let's create
a little helper:</p>
<pre><code>makeStage :: Show e => String -> (i -> Either e o) -> Stage i o
makeStage name r = Stage name (r >>> stageEither name)</code></pre>
<p>We can work on any function <code>i -> Either e o</code>, so long as it has an error we can use <code>show</code> with,
as explained earlier. We also include the name of the stage here.</p>
<p>We can go ahead and define a stage for our lexer:</p>
<pre><code>lexerStage :: Stage String [Lexer.Token]
lexerStage = makeStage "Lexer" Lexer.lexer</code></pre>
<p>Everything works out nicely, because we took care to design our little Stage abstraction around
how the different parts of our compiler actually work.</p>
<p>We'd also like to be able to compose our stages together; that's why we're creating this whole abstraction.
Let's make a little helper operator:</p>
<pre><code>(>->) :: Stage a b -> Stage b c -> Stage a c
(>->) (Stage _ r1) (Stage n2 r2) = Stage n2 (r1 >=> r2)</code></pre>
<p>See the similarity here with:</p>
<pre><code>(>>>) :: (a -> b) -> (b -> c) -> (a -> c)</code></pre>
<p>One detail we do here is that the name of the composed stage is just the name of the second stage. We could've
opted to make a new name, like <code>Lexer >-> Parser</code> or something.
This option actually makes more sense, because each stage
depends on the previous one, and we never run one half of the stages without the other half. We only
<em>stop early</em>, sometimes.</p>
<p>Now, let's add some code to create an <code>IO</code> action from a given Stage:</p>
<pre><code>printStage :: Show b => Stage a b -> a -> IO ()
printStage (Stage name r) a = case r a of
  Left err -> do
    printStagedError err
    exitFailure
  Right b -> do
    putStrLn (name ++ ":")
    pPrint b</code></pre>
<p>The idea is that we create a function accepting the Stage's input, and then printing out whatever
output it produces, or printing the error, and terminating the program with <code>exitFailure</code>, indicating that a failure occurred.</p>
<h3>Parsing Arguments</h3>
<p>We're getting close to having a little program we can run! The next thing we'll be doing is defining
a type for the <em>arguments</em> our program accepts from the command line:</p>
<pre><code>data Args = Args FilePath (String -> IO ())</code></pre>
<p>The first part will be path to the Haskell code we're handling, but the second part is a bit unorthodox.
The idea is that it represents the stage we've parsed. We could have created an enum for which stage the user
wants to go up to, and then interpreted that to make an IO action, but it's easier to just parse
out an action directly. The reason we have this <code>String -> IO ()</code> representation is that every single
stage is able to hide behind it. We'll be creating <code>Stage String b</code> for each of our "go up to this part"
stages. They all take in the source code as input, but the output varies. We can use <code>printStage</code>
to get around this, and store all of the stages in the same way.</p>
<p>Here's how we'll be reading the stages:</p>
<pre><code>readStage :: String -> Maybe (String -> IO ())
readStage "lex" = lexerStage |> printStage |> Just
readStage _ = Nothing</code></pre>
<p>For now, we just accept a single stage "lex", which runs the only stage we have, and prints out
the results.</p>
<p>Then, to use the args we've produced, we just read in the source file, and then run the action:</p>
<pre><code>process :: Args -> IO ()
process (Args path stage) = do
  content <- readFile path
  stage content</code></pre>
<p>Since we've already read in the stage as <code>String -> IO ()</code>, this works out just fine.</p>
<p>We can now write a function to parse out all of the arguments:</p>
<pre><code>parseArgs :: [String] -> Maybe Args
parseArgs (stageName : file : _) =
  Args file <$> readStage (map toLower stageName)
parseArgs _ = Nothing</code></pre>
<p>This takes in the list of arguments as passed in to the program, and returns the parsed arguments.
The only trick here is that we lower case the stage name, so that "lex", "LEX", "lEx", etc. refer
to the same stage.
For example for:</p>
<pre><code>haskell-in-haskell lex file.hs</code></pre>
<p>We would have:</p>
<pre><code>["lex", "file.hs"]</code></pre>
<p>as our arguments.</p>
<h3>Remaining Glue</h3>
<p>Finally, we can modify <code>main</code> to glue all of these functions together:</p>
<pre><code>main :: IO ()
main = do
  stringArgs <- getArgs
  case parseArgs stringArgs of
    Nothing -> putStrLn "Unrecognized arguments"
    Just args -> process args</code></pre>
<p><code>getArgs :: IO [String]</code> returns the command line arguments passed to us. We then use these to
parse out <code>Args</code>,
printing out a failure message, or proceeding with the <code>process</code> function we defined earlier.</p>
<p>Now we can actually run the lexer, to see something like</p>
<pre><code>> cabal run haskell-in-haskell -- lex foo.hs
Lexer Error:
UnimplementedError</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] <strong>Note:</strong>
Here we have to do a little Cabal-fu to correctly pass the arguments we want to our program. Everything
after the <code>--</code> belongs to <em>our program</em>, everything before is read by <code>cabal</code>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oof, that was a mouthful, but now all of this boilerplate is out of our way for the rest of the compiler.
Adding new stages is going to be a breeze!</p>
<h1>How do you make a Lexer?</h1>
<p>That was a dive into some practical Haskell, although mostly boilerplate. Now let's go back
up a layer of abstraction, and think a bit about what a lexer really is, and how it works in theory.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, our lexer will be scanning over our input string character by character,
outputting tokens as it goes.</p>
<p>
<img src=../Images/b6d51ee33eb64f099b2552fee11bc0ef44e73851f48691807d0f23d439d5b3ea.png alt= /></p>
<p>For simple operators, it's easy to understand how our lexer is going to work. For example, if we have
some operators like:</p>
<pre><code>+*-</code></pre>
<p>the lexer can see the <code>+</code>, and then immediately spit out a <code>Plus</code> token, or something like that.
When it sees the <code>*</code>, it spits out <code>Times</code>, with <code>-</code>, we get <code>Sub</code>, etc.</p>
<p>
<img src=../Images/c6860d9b1b6e7c3f46a45e945e05c1c39b54b0da502e469bb90e25c6c0638b79.png alt= /></p>
<p>If our lexer sees a character it doesn't know, it can blow up with an error:</p>
<p>
<img src=../Images/7a495e2f890386550cf2b08617027b052e5c73fcee6777e35a1cda01cc62ad32.png alt= /></p>
<p>For some other characters, the lexer will simply ignore them:</p>
<p>
<img src=../Images/acccf535c389b02568f0d3b056368c525f353ec5ce3e160db54fc36886ebea8d.png alt= /></p>
<p>If we only need to lex out single characters, then an interesting thing to notice is
that our lexer keeps track of no state whatsoever. After seeing a single character, the lexer
is straight back to the same state it started with, ready to accept another character.</p>
<h2>Character Classes</h2>
<p>Our lexer will have to produce tokens composed of more than just a single character
of input. Integers, for example. We want to accept things like <code>3</code>, <code>234</code>, <code>2239034</code>. Integer literals
can be arbitrary strings of digits. To handle this, our lexer needs to enter a different "mode",
or "state" as soon as it sees a digit. Instead of immediately producing some output, it instead shifts
to a mode where it tries to consume the digits that remain, and only "breaks out" once it sees something that
isn't a digit. At that point, it can produce the token for that integer literal, and return back to its
initial state.</p>
<p>Many more of the tokens we produce will involve multiple characters. For example, to match out against a string
literal like <code>"Hello World"</code>, we need to realize that a string literal is happening when we see
Athe <code>"</code>, and then keep on consuming characters for that literal until we see the closing <code>"</code>.</p>
<p>Quite a few tokens in our language will be keywords. For example, <code>let</code>, <code>where</code>, <code>data</code>, <code>type</code>. These can be
consumed using "modes" or "states" as well. For example, when we see an <code>l</code>, our lexer could enter a mode
expecting to see <code>e</code>, followed by <code>t</code> to finish out the keyword.</p>
<p>So far we're developing a vision of a lexer as a "finite state machine". The idea is that at any point
in time, our lexer is in a given state, and we can move to different states as we see different characters,
potentially spitting out some tokens along the way. For example, a state machine that accepts arithmetic tokens
like <code>2 + 23 * 44</code> would look like:</p>
<p>
<img src=../Images/00835d8bfaccde2ebf9195783354a945a172dff739f905f6164092c4c8ba2807.png alt= /></p>
<p>This state machine idea is also intimately connected to <em>regular expressions</em>, and in fact all
the different classes of characters that make up our tokens correspond to regular expressions, and we
should be able to recognize whether or not our source code is lexically valid with a giant regex.</p>
<p>There's a rich theory around the connection between lexers, regular expressions, and state machines,
so I'll refer you to other resources if you're interested in that.</p>
<p>There's <a href=https://craftinginterpreters.com/scanning.html>a great chapter</a>
on lexing in
<a href=https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html>Crafting Interpreters</a>, which explains these
concerns in much more detail.</p>
<p><a href=https://www.elsevier.com/books/engineering-a-compiler/cooper/978-0-12-088478-0>Engineering a Compiler</a>
also has a good section on lexing, if you <em>really</em> want a <em>lot more</em> detail.</p>
<h2>Longest Match</h2>
<p>Another issue we've completely glossed over is that of conflicts between different classes of characters.
We've specifically looked at nice examples where everything is in a completely different bubble, with no
interaction between the different characters.</p>
<p>

<p>Now, the biggest source of ambiguity is between identifiers and keywords. For example,
if we see <code>where</code>, then that is the keyword <code>where</code>. No ambiguity whatsoever, but if we add just
one character, to get <code>where2</code>, then suddenly that's an identifier, and <code>where2 = 3</code> is a valid bit
of Haskell. So our previous idea of seeing a <code>w</code>, and jumping straight towards assuming we've seen
the start of the keyword <code>where</code> is not going to work. In fact, if we have some kind of rule like:
"an identifier is a lower case alpha character followed by any number of alphas and digits", then it
conflicts with every single keyword!</p>
<p>How do we choose which to pick?</p>
<p>The idea is that we should keep applying a rule <em>greedily</em>. That is, if there are two possible ways
of pulling out a token from some string, we pick out the one that consumes more input. So if we see
<code>wherefoo</code>, we can parse this in two ways:</p>
<pre><code>where (Keyword) foo
wherefoo (Identifier)</code></pre>
<p>But we should clearly accept the second one, because it consumed more of the input. This rule is
enough to disambiguate keywords and identifiers, as long as we give priority to keywords, for
when we have an exact match.</p>
<h1>Lexer Combinators</h1>
<p>So, that was a quick overview of some of the abstract ideas around lexing, and now let's dive
into creating a little framework in Haskell for building up our lexer. The idea is that
we want to be able to build up a large lexer for Haskell source code from lexers
for smaller parts.</p>
<p>To do this we'll use <em>Lexer Combinators</em>, a topic I've already talked about
<a href=/posts/20202/10/lexical-combinators>previously</a>.
See that post if you want even more detail and explanation after what we see here.</p>
<h2>The Basic Definition</h2>
<p>The basic idea of a Lexer Combinator is that a lexer is nothing more than a function
taking in some input, in our case, a <code>String</code>, and then either throwing an error, because
it does not recognize what it sees, or consuming part of the input, returning a value,
along with the remaining part of the input it hasn't touched.</p>
<p>So, something like <code>String -> Either LexerError (a, String)</code> in Haskell syntax. In fact,
let's go ahead and go back to <code>src/Lexer.hs</code>.</p>
<h3>Imports</h3>
<p>As is going to become a custom throughout this series, we're add
all of the imports we need for the rest of this module right away:</p>
<pre><code>import Control.Applicative (Alternative (..), liftA2)
import Control.Monad.Except (ExceptT, MonadError (throwError), runExceptT)
import Control.Monad.State (State, gets, modify', runState)
import Data.Char (isAlphaNum, isDigit, isLower, isSpace, isUpper)
import Data.List (foldl', foldl1')
import Data.Maybe (listToMaybe, maybeToList)
import Ourlude</code></pre>
<p>We have some utilities for checking properties of characters, some convenient list
folds that sadly aren't in the default Prelude, and the helper <code>listToMaybe</code>. The other
monadic stuff will be introduced in due time as we get to using these utilities</p>
<h3>Errors</h3>
<p>Let's go ahead and redefine the type of errors that our lexer will be producing:</p>
<pre><code>data LexerError
  = Unexpected Char
  | UnexpectedEOF
  | UnmatchedLayout
  deriving ()</code></pre>
<p>The first, <code>Unexpected char</code>, is used when we encounter a character that we don't know
how to handle. <code>UnexpectedEOF</code> is when we reach the end of the input string before
we're done lexing some token. For example, if you start a string literal,
but never end it, like <code>"abbbbb</code>, then you'll get an <code>UnexpectedEOF</code> when all
of the input has been consumed.</p>
<p>The last error is related to whitespace inference, and will be explained more once
we reach that part.</p>
<p>We can go ahead create a utility function to throw the right error given the remaining input:</p>
<pre><code>unexpected :: String -> LexerError
unexpected [] = UnexpectedEOF
unexpected (c : _) = Unexpected c</code></pre>
<p>If there's no input left, and we're in an unexpected situation, then we weren't expecting
the input to end so early, and should produce an <code>UnexpectedEOF</code> error, otherwise seeing
whatever character is at the front of our input was the problem</p>
<h3>The Core Type</h3>
<p>Now let's define the actual data type for lexers:</p>
<pre><code>newtype Lexer a = Lexer {
  runLexer :: String -> Either LexerError (a, String)
}</code></pre>
<p>So a <code>Lexer</code> is nothing more than a wrapper around a function taking in some input,
and either failing with a <code>LexerError</code>, or producing a value of type <code>a</code>, and the remaining
string that we have yet to consume.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] <strong>Note:</strong>
We could've defined <code>Lexer</code> to be a <em>type synonym</em>, rather than an entirely new type. The reason we want
a newtype is the be able to easily define new instances of different typeclasses for the
<code>Lexer</code> type.</p></blockquote>
<p>We can go ahead and write a few basic "building blocks" that we'll be needing later.</p>
<p>The first lexer we'll make is one that accepts a single character matching a predicate,
producing whatever character was accepted:</p>
<pre><code>satisfies :: (Char -> Bool) -> Lexer Char
satisfies p =
  Lexer <| \case
    c : cs | p c -> Right (c, cs)
    rest -> Left (unexpected rest)</code></pre>
<p>This inspects the input we've been given, and only consumes the first character if it can
pull it out of the string, and it satisfies the predicate we've been given.</p>
<p>An immediate application of this lexer is:</p>
<pre><code>char :: Char -> Lexer Char
char target = satisfies (== target)</code></pre>
<p>which will match an exact character. So we might do <code>char '+'</code>, for example.</p>
<p>Now we need to implement some fundamental typeclasses for <code>Lexer</code>, which will be
used for composing them together.</p>
<h3>Functor</h3>
<p>The first is the venerable <code>Functor</code> class:</p>
<pre><code>instance Functor Lexer where
  fmap f (Lexer l) = Lexer (l >>> fmap (first f))</code></pre>
<p>Here we have</p>
<pre><code>fmap :: (a -> b) -> Lexer a -> Lexer b</code></pre>
<p>as the concrete type for this function. All this does really is do some plumbing
to change the output our lexer produces; <code>fmap</code> has no effect whatsoever on
what characters a lexer accepts.</p>
<p>
<img src=../Images/30233c3b525770562df04a190d0c93885b8e086d33ae675e7435a716dd8c986f.png alt= /></p>
<p>This also gives us access to other functions that use <code>Functor</code>, for example,
we could now transform <code>fmap (const Plus) (char '+')</code> into
<code>Plus <$ char '+'</code>, since <code><$ :: Functor f => a -> f b -> f a</code> is defined for
any type implementing <code>Functor</code>.</p>
<h3>Applicative</h3>
<p>The next type class is <code>Applicative</code>, which in concrete terms, requires us to define
two functions:</p>
<pre><code>pure :: a -> Lexer a

(<*>) :: Lexer (a -> b) -> Lexer a -> Lexer b</code></pre>
<p>The concrete idea here is that <code>pure</code> will create a <code>Lexer</code> that produces
a value with consuming any input whatsoever. <code><*></code> will allow us to combine
two lexers sequentially, using the function output by the first,
and the value output by the second to produce a final result.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] <strong>Note:</strong>
A function equivalent
in power would be:</p>
<pre><code>both :: Lexer a -> Lexer b -> Lexer (a, b)</code></pre>
<p>which expresses the idea a bit more clearly, in my opinion.
Here it's clear that we need to run both lexers, ending up
with the combined outputs from both.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, let's implement it:</p>
<pre><code>instance Applicative Lexer where
  pure a = Lexer (\input -> Right (a, input))
  Lexer lF <*> Lexer lA =
    Lexer <| \input -> do
      (f, rest) <- lF input
      (a, s) <- lA rest
      return (f a, s)</code></pre>
<p><code>pure</code> is pretty self-explanatory, we simply pass along the input without consuming anything,
as explained before.</p>
<p>For <code><*></code>, things are a bit more interesting. Notice how we're making use of <code>do</code> for <code>Either LexerError</code>
here. Another important detail is the we use the remaining input of the first lexer to
feed to the second lexer. This might seem like a bit of an arbitrary choice, but it's actually important.</p>
<p>For example, <code>(,) <$> char 'A' <*> char 'B'</code> should accept the string <code>"AB"</code>. To do this, we need
to have consumed the character <code>A</code> before "moving on" to the second lexer.</p>
<p>In fact, now that we have <code>Applicative</code>, we can get a lexer recognizing an entire string "for free"</p>
<pre><code>string :: String -> Lexer String
string = traverse char</code></pre>
<p>This uses the very cool <code>traverse :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> [a] -> f [b]</code>, which in our case,
first makes a bunch of lexers recognizing each respective character in a given string, and
then sequences them to recognize the entire string, one character at a time.</p>
<h2>Alternative</h2>
<p>We can create somewhat sophisticated lexers parsing long strings by chaining them sequentially with
<code><*></code>, but one thing that's sorely missing is the ability to <em>choose</em> between different options.
I can take two lexers and say "I want to lex <code>A</code>, followed by <code>B</code>", but I can't say "I want to lex <code>A</code>, or
<code>B</code>". Our tokens are going to need this mechanism. Each token is going to be one of the options we
can choose from.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there's a type class for this: <code>Alternative</code>.
Concretely, it requires us to implement:</p>
<pre><code>empty :: Lexer a

(<|>) :: Lexer a -> Lexer a -> Lexer a</code></pre>
<p><code><|></code> implements the intuitive notion of choice we want, and <code>empty</code> acts as the identity for this operation,
that is to say:</p>
<pre><code>empty <|> lexerA = lexerA = lexerA <|> empty</code></pre>
<p>Now, <code><|></code> is going to have to run both of the parsers. If one of them fails, then we have to rely
on the result of the other one. If both succeed, then we have to implement the longest match rule
we talked about earlier. If this results in a tie, then we want to give priority to the left one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] <strong>Note:</strong>
Prioritizing the left lexer over the right lexer is a completely arbitrary choice,
but a choice that needs to be made, and will result in fun bugs if you forget that it <em>was</em> made.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let's implement the class:</p>
<pre><code>instance Alternative Lexer where
  empty = Lexer (Left <<< unexpected)
  Lexer lA <|> Lexer lB =
    Lexer <| \input -> case (lA input, lB input) of
      (res, Left _) -> res
      (Left _, res) -> res
      (a@(Right (_, restA)), b@(Right (_, restB))) ->
        if length restA <= length restB then a else b</code></pre>
<p>For <code>empty</code>, we have a lexer that will fail on any input.</p>
<p>For <code><|></code>, we pattern match on <em>both</em> the results given the same input, at the same time. If one of them fails,
we rely on the other result. If both succeed, we need to dive in a bit more, and compare the lengths of
the remaining inputs. We pick the result that has less input remaining, i.e. that has consumed <em>more</em> input,
i.e. that is the longest match.
On ties, when the remaining inputs have equal length, we still choose <code>a</code>.
This means that we're biased towards the left lexer, as we talked about earlier.</p>
<p>We can once again put this to use, and create a helper letting us create
a lexer choosing one out of many options:</p>
<pre><code>oneOf :: Alternative f => [f a] -> f a
oneOf = foldl1' (<|>)</code></pre>
<p>This will work with other <code>Alternative</code> types, and not just <code>Lexer</code>, although we won't
be exercising that option here.</p>
<p>With that done, we now have all of the building blocks and combinators we need
to make a real lexer for Haskell!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] <strong>Note:</strong>
This implementation of Lexer Combinators is actually somewhat inefficient. There
are ways to improve the performance without changing the interface completely,
keeping the same core approach. I don't go over these here, for the sake of simplicity,
but better libraries should be used in a production compiler.</p></blockquote>
<h1>Implementing the Lexer</h1>
<p>Alright, we've created a bit of a framework for building lexers. This might seem a bit
abstract right now, but will all fit into place very quickly as we put it into practice.</p>
<h2>Tokens</h2>
<p>The first thing we need to do is actually define the type of tokens we want our lexer to return.</p>
<p>We need a couple classes of tokens, basically:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Keywords</strong>, like <code>where</code>, <code>let</code>, <code>case</code></li><li><strong>Operators</strong>, like <code>+</code>, <code>-></code>, <code>::</code></li><li><strong>Literals</strong>, which we have for <code>Bool</code>, <code>Int</code>, and <code>String</code></li><li><strong>Hardcoded primitive types</strong>, in our case <code>Bool</code>, <code>Int</code>, and <code>String</code></li><li><strong>Identifiers</strong>, which come in two flavors in Haskell.</li></ol>
<p>I apologize for the information dump, but it's easier to just write them
all out, since most of them are just dumb labels:</p>
<pre><code>data Token
  = Let -- `let`
  | Where -- `where`
  | In -- `in`
  | Data -- `data`
  | Type -- `type`
  | If -- `if`
  | Then -- `then`
  | Else -- `else`
  | Case -- `case`
  | Of -- `of`
  | Underscore -- `_`
  | OpenParens -- `(`
  | CloseParens -- `)`
  | OpenBrace -- `{`
  | CloseBrace -- `}`
  | Semicolon -- `;`
  | DoubleColon -- `::`
  | ThinArrow -- `->`
  | VBar -- `|`
  | BSlash -- `\`
  | FSlash -- `/`
  | Plus -- `+`
  | PlusPlus -- `++`
  | Dash -- `-`
  | Asterisk -- `*`
  | Equal -- `=`
  | Dollar -- `$`
  | LeftAngle -- `<`
  | Dot -- `.`
  | LeftAngleEqual -- `<=`
  | RightAngle -- `>`
  | RightAngleEqual -- `>=`
  | EqualEqual -- `==`
  | FSlashEqual -- `/=`
  | VBarVBar -- `||`
  | AmpersandAmpersand -- `&&`

  -- The type `Bool`
  | BoolTypeName
  -- A name starting with an uppercase letter
  | UpperName String
  -- A name starting witha lowercase letter
  | LowerName String
  deriving (Eq, Show)</code></pre>
<p>The literals for <code>Int</code>, <code>String</code>, and <code>Bool</code> have values of the corresponding types, as
we might expect. Haskell has this peculiarity where identifiers come in two flavors, the <em>upper case</em>
identifiers, like <code>Foo230</code> and <code>Baz240</code>, which are used to indicate types, and <em>lower case</em>, like <code>fooA343</code>,
or <code>bazB334</code>.</p>
<h2>A lexer for tokens</h2>
<p>Now, we can write a <code>Lexer</code> that produces these tokens!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] <strong>Note:</strong>
We'll actually be writing a <code>Lexer (Token, String)</code>, which includes the parsed string, along
with the token. We'll need this in a bit once we want to handle whitespace and layouts,
but for now it's superfluous. I've decided to go ahead and do it this way so we
can avoid having to spend time rewriting 40 lines of code later.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have:</p>
<pre><code>token :: Lexer (Token, String)
token = keyword <|> operator <|> literal <|> name
  where
    with :: Functor f => b -> f a -> f (b, a)
    with b = fmap (b,)

    ...</code></pre>
<p><code>with</code> is nothing more than a little helper we'll be using shortly. Our lexer is defined
in terms of a handful of sub-lexers we'll also be defining in that <code>where</code> block. The
high-level idea is that we're saying that a token is either a keyword,
an operator, a literal, or a name. Notice that we put <code>keyword</code> to the <em>left</em>
of <code>name</code>, so that keywords have priority over identifiers!</p>
<p>Keywords are defined as lexers accepting exactly the right string:</p>
<pre><code>    keyword :: Lexer (Token, String)
    keyword =
      oneOf
        [ Let `with` string "let",
          Where `with` string "where",
          In `with` string "in",
          Data `with` string "data",
          Type `with` string "type",
          If `with` string "if",
          Then `with` string "then",
          Else `with` string "else",
          Case `with` string "case",
          Of `with` string "of",
          Underscore `with` string "_"
        ]</code></pre>
<p>Here we're using <code>with</code> in infix notation, in order to include the string along with the token, which we'll
be needing later. Another fun detail is that we consider <code>_</code> to be a keyword. Whether or not
something is a keyword is more so about making the parser's job easier, rather than reflecting the
semantics of the language. We could've made <code>_</code> just a normal identifier, but then we would have had
to do extra work to separate out this token in the parser.</p>
<p>Anyhow, let's look at operators:</p>
<pre><code>    operator :: Lexer (Token, String)
    operator =
      oneOf
        [ OpenParens `with` string "(",
          CloseParens `with` string ")",
          OpenBrace `with` string "{",
          CloseBrace `with` string "}",
          Semicolon `with` string ";",
          DoubleColon `with` string "::",
          ThinArrow `with` string "->",
          VBar `with` string "|",
          BSlash `with` string "\\",
          FSlash `with` string "/",
          Plus `with` string "+",
          PlusPlus `with` string "++",
          Dash `with` string "-",
          Asterisk `with` string "*",
          Equal `with` string "=",
          Dot `with` string ".",
          Dollar `with` string "$",
          LeftAngle `with` string "<",
          LeftAngleEqual `with` string "<=",
          RightAngle `with` string ">",
          RightAngleEqual `with` string ">=",
          FSlashEqual `with` string "/=",
          EqualEqual `with` string "==",
          VBarVBar `with` string "||",
          AmpersandAmpersand `with` string "&&"
        ]</code></pre>
<p>Once again, we're just mapping strings to labels. All of the code to do the lexing work
is taken care of by the framework we set up before!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] <strong>Note:</strong>
For parsing the operator <code>\</code>, we need to create an escaped slash inside of the string,
hence <code>"\\"</code>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now let's move on to something a bit more interesting: literals:</p>
<pre><code>    literal :: Lexer (Token, String)
    literal = intLit <|> stringLit <|> boolLit
      where
        ...</code></pre>
<p>So, a literal is either an integer literal, a string literal, or a bool literal, as we
went over above.</p>
<p>For integers, we have:</p>
<pre><code>        intLit :: Lexer (Token, String)
        intLit =
          some (satisfies isDigit)
            |> fmap (\x -> (IntLit (read x), x))</code></pre>
<p>So, <code>some</code> accepts one or more of a given lexer. It's actually defined for any <code>Alternative</code>!
We accept one or more digits, and then use <code>read</code> to parse that string of digits as an actual <code>Int</code></p>
<p>For strings, we have:</p>
<pre><code>        stringLit :: Lexer (Token, String)
        stringLit =
          char '"' *> many (satisfies (/= '"')) <* char '"'
            |> fmap (\x -> (StringLit x, x))</code></pre>
<p>The idea is that we require a <code>"</code>, followed by many characters that
are <em>not</em> the closing <code>"</code>, and then that closing <code>"</code>. Our manipulation with
<code>*></code> and <code><*</code> just makes sure that we don't include the delimiters in our string literal.</p>
<p>And finally, we have boolean literals:</p>
<pre><code>        boolLit :: Lexer (Token, String)
        boolLit =
          (BoolLit True `with` string "True")
            <|> (BoolLit False `with` string "False")</code></pre>
<p>This approach is the same we used for keywords and operators before, and makes sense
since we only have two values for <code>Bool</code>.</p>
<p>Now the only remaining "sub-lexer" is for names, where we'll also be including
the names of primitive types:</p>
<pre><code>    name :: Lexer (Token, String)
    name = primName <|> upperName <|> lowerName
      where
        ...</code></pre>
<p>A name is either the name for a primitive type (with priority), a name starting with an upper case alpha,
or a name starting with lower case alpha.</p>
<p>For primitive names, we use the same approach as with keywords:</p>
<pre><code>        primName :: Lexer (Token, String)
        primName =
          (IntTypeName `with` string "Int")
            <|> (StringTypeName `with` string "String")
            <|> (BoolTypeName `with` string "Bool")</code></pre>
<p>For normal names, we want a few helpers as well:</p>
<pre><code>        continuesName :: Lexer Char
        continuesName = satisfies isAlphaNum <|> char '\''

        followedBy :: Lexer Char -> Lexer Char -> Lexer String
        followedBy l1 l2 = liftA2 (:) l1 (many l2)

        upperName :: Lexer (Token, String)
        upperName =
          (satisfies isUpper `followedBy` continuesName)
            |> fmap (\x -> (UpperName x, x))

        lowerName :: Lexer (Token, String)
        lowerName =
          (satisfies isLower `followedBy` continuesName)
            |> fmap (\x -> (LowerName x, x))</code></pre>
<p><code>continuesName</code> is a class of characters that can appear after the first character of an identifier,
allowing us to "continue" that identifier. This includes any alphanumeric character, as well as the <code>'</code>,
which Haskell also allows.</p>
<p>We then have a helper, <code>followedBy</code>, which parses the first class of things, followed by
zero or more occurrences of the second thing. <code>many</code>, is like <code>some</code>, except it allows zero occurrences
as well.</p>
<p>With these in hand, are two different kinds of name are simple to define. the difference is that
one starts with an upper case character, and the other starts with a lower case character.</p>
<h2>An actual lexer</h2>
<p>Now, let's actually replace our <code>lexer</code> function to use this framework:</p>
<pre><code>lexer :: String -> Either LexError [Token]
lexer = runLexer (some token)</code></pre>
<p>instead of <code>token</code>, which only parses a single token, we use <code>some</code> to parse one or more occurrences of a token.
At this point, we should be able to lex out some interesting things, although we won't be handling
whitespace between tokens until then.</p>
<p>Let's try out a few examples.</p>
<p>You can actually run these at this point, creating a file <code>foo.hs</code> to contain
the examples, and then using:</p>
<pre><code>cabal run haskell-in-haskell -- lex foo.hs</code></pre>
<p>And then running this on:</p>
<pre><code>x=2+2</code></pre>
<p>should output</p>
<pre><code>[ LowerName "x"
, Equal
, IntLit 2
, Plus
, IntLit 2
]</code></pre>
<p>We can also accept things that make no sense syntactically:</p>
<pre><code>x->::Int</code></pre>
<p>which outputs:</p>
<pre><code>[ LowerName "x"
, ThinArrow
, DoubleColon
, IntTypeName
]</code></pre>
<p>We can already have a lot of fun doing things like this right now!
It's satisfying to start to see a bit of vim from our compiler. But
we really need to be able to handle spaces, and also infer semicolons and braces!</p>
<h1>Handling Whitespace</h1>
<p>Right now we have a lexer for all of the basic building blocks of Haskell, but
it can't handle any whitespace at all! There are two aspects of whitespace that
we're going to be tackling in this section.</p>
<p>Haskell, like basically every language, allows you to put plenty of space
between tokens. For example, what we can now lex:</p>
<pre><code>x=2+2*2</code></pre>
<p>could also be written in the prettier form:</p>
<pre><code>x = 2 + 2 * 2</code></pre>
<p>or even:</p>
<pre><code>x   = 2    +    *    2</code></pre>
<p>These should all generate the same tokens. The bits of whitespace contribute nothing,
and should be ignored.</p>
<p>In C, for example, everything is delimited using braces and semicolons, so arbitrary
amounts of both vertical and horizontal whitespaces are simply completely ignored when
lexing. You could remove all whitespace from your program and get the same result.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] <strong>Note:</strong>
Actually, whitespace <em>does</em> matter in C because of the preprocessor, but you get the idea.</p></blockquote>
<p>In Haskell, on the other hand, whitespace <em>can be significant</em>, when it's used to create layouts
where braces and semicolons should be inferred. This layout inference is the second aspect that we'll be
working on, and is much more complicated than simply ignoring whitespace. In fact,
because of this aspect, we <em>can't</em> just take the easy approach of filtering out whitespace characters
as a whole, and instead need to be quite picky about what whitespace we see, since vertical
whitespaces acts differently than horizonal whitespace.</p>
<h2>Haskell's layout structure</h2>
<p>I'm assuming that you've programmed a reasonable amount in Haskell before, so you're probably
familiar on an intuitive level with how you can use whitespace to layout blocks.
In fact, you probably haven't used braces and semicolons in your programs,
and maybe you didn't even know they were an option. Let's try to go from our
intuition about how things should work, to a more robust understanding.</p>
<p>As an example, consider something like:</p>
<pre><code>x = foo + bar
  where
    foo = 3
    bar = 4
    
y = 3</code></pre>
<p>The first rule that you've likely internalized is that everything
at the same level of indentation <em>continues</em> whatever the current block is.
Because <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> are at the same level of indentation, we expect
them to be in the same block.</p>
<p>Similarly, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are in the same block. This rule also makes it so that
we have to indent the <code>where</code>, so that it belongs to <code>x</code>, and is not seen
as continuing the same layout that <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> belong to.</p>
<p>We also require that <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> are further indented than the <code>where</code>.</p>
<p>With explicit braces and semicolons, we have:</p>
<pre><code>{
x = foo + bar
  where {
    foo = 3;
    bar = 4
  }
;
  
y = 3
}</code></pre>
<p>This is just the realization of our implicit intuition about where scopes should be,
and how they work.</p>
<p>A final rule we've all internalized is that layouts only happen after certain keywords.</p>
<p>When we see:</p>
<pre><code>x =
  2 + 3
  * f x</code></pre>
<p>everything after the <code>=</code> is just a single expression, all bound to <code>x</code>. This all belong
to <code>x</code> because they're further indented, but no layout has been introduced after the <code>=</code>.</p>
<p>If we generate semicolons like this:</p>
<pre><code>x = {
  2 + 3;
  * f x
}</code></pre>
<p>that would obviously not be correct.</p>
<p>on the other hand, from a lexical point of view, if we had:</p>
<pre><code>x = a
  where
    2 + 3
    * f x</code></pre>
<p>then we should insert a layout, and end up with:</p>
<pre><code>{
x = a
  where {
   2 + 3;
   * f x
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>where</code> keyword make us ready to see this kind of whitespace
sensitive layout of code. The other keywords like this (for our subset) include <code>let</code>, and <code>of</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] <strong>Note:</strong>
This program might like odd, because it isn't a program! This is not syntactically valid
Haskell, our parser will reject it. On the other hand, from a perspective of whitespace sensitivity,
nothing fishy is going on, and it's not the lexer's job to decide that <code>2 + 3</code> is not a valid
term in the bindings after <code>where</code>.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Position Information</h2>
<p>With our intuitive understanding, we've realized that it's very important
to keep track of "where" a token is, both "vertically", and "horizontally".</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>x = y</code></pre>
<p>does not yield the same layout as:</p>
<pre><code>x =

y</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>let
  x = 1
  y = 2 
in</code></pre>
<p>should not yield the same layout as:</p>
<pre><code>let
  x = 1
    y = 2
in</code></pre>
<p>What column a token appears at is quite important.
Whether or not a token is at the start of a line also matters.
We'll need to annotate our tokens with this position information.</p>
<p>So, in <code>Lexer.hs</code>, let's create some types to represent this information:</p>
<pre><code>data LinePosition = Start | Middle deriving (Eq, Show)

data Positioned a = Positioned a LinePosition Int deriving (Eq, Show)</code></pre>
<p><code>Positioned a</code> adds position information to something of type <code>a</code>. We
include the <code>a</code> itself, followed by its <code>LinePosition</code>,
and the exact column at which it appears.</p>
<p>What we'll be doing soon enough is making a function <code>[Positioned Token] -> [Token]</code>,
using that extra position information to infer the necessary braces and semicolons.</p>
<p>Right now though, we just have <code>[Token]</code>, without any position information,
and no braces and semicolons.</p>
<h3>Raw Tokens</h3>
<p>In fact, our lexer simply blows up if it encounters any whitespace tokens,
and we can't handle comments either. The next order of business is being
able to lex whitespace and comments along with normal tokens.</p>
<p>If we weren't whitespace sensitive, we'd still need to do this. We would
simply collect all of these tokens, and then filter them out from
the final output. This way, we could allow arbitrary spacing between tokens,
as well as comments in the source code, without affecting the rest of the tokens.</p>
<p>For our purposes, it's important to keep these tokens, so we can annotate the
other "normal" tokens with position information. We'll be using the whitespace
and comment tokens around them to figure out how they're positioned within the file.</p>
<p>So, let's define a new token type that adds these extra variants:</p>
<pre><code>data RawToken
  = Blankspace String
  | Comment String
  | Newline
  | NormalToken Token String</code></pre>
<p><code>Blankspace</code> represents "horizontal" whitespace, i.e whitespace containing no newlines. For
newlines, we have the <code>Newline</code> token. We also have comments, with the <code>Comment</code>
constructor, and then finally a little wrapper for normal tokens, along with their string contents.</p>
<p>Let's go ahead and create a lexer for these raw tokens:</p>
<pre><code>-- A Lexer for raw tokens
rawLexer :: Lexer [RawToken]
rawLexer = some (whitespace <|> comment <|> rawToken)
  where
    rawToken = fmap (uncurry NormalToken) token
    ...</code></pre>
<p>So, our raw lexer parses at least one occurrence of a raw token, which is either
whitespace, a comment, or a normal token.</p>
<p>For comments, we need to parse a <code>--</code>, and then the rest of the line:</p>
<pre><code>    comment = Comment <$> (string "--" *> many (satisfies (/= '\n')))</code></pre>
<p>To allow for empty comments, we pick <code>many</code> instead of <code>some</code>.</p>
<p>Now, for whitespace, we can either have horizontal whitespace, or a single newline:</p>
<pre><code>    whitespace = blankspace <|> newline</code></pre>
<p>If we have multiple newlines, we'll end up generating multiple tokens.</p>
<p>Horizontal whitespace is just one or more whitespace characters that are <em>not</em>
newlines:</p>
<pre><code>    blankspace =
      Blankspace <$>
        some (satisfies (\x -> isSpace x && x /= '\n'))</code></pre>
<p>And a newline is generated when we see a <code>\n</code>:</p>
<pre><code>    newline = Newline <$ char '\n'</code></pre>
<p>With that, we can now parse out the whitespaces and comments.
We could now make a lexer for "whitespace insensitive Haskell", if we wanted to.
We would replace <code>some token</code> with <code>rawLexer</code>, in our <code>lexer</code> function,
and then filter out the normal tokens.</p>
<h3>Positioning Tokens</h3>
<p>The next step is using all of this information to annotate
the normal tokens using the <code>Positioned</code> type we defined earlier.
We want to have a function <code>[RawToken] -> [Positioned Token]</code>. Given the
list of raw tokens, we produce a list of tokens with positions. In the process,
all of the whitespace and comment tokens are discarded.</p>
<p>The basic idea of the algorithm is going to be a somewhat imperative one.
We'll keep track of <code>(LinePosition, Int)</code>, which will serve as the position of the next token,
when we end up producing it. As we see raw tokens, we'll update this state,
or actually produce a token positioned with this information.</p>
<p>In practice, we have this:</p>
<pre><code>type PosState = (LinePosition, Int)

position :: [RawToken] -> [Positioned Token]
position = foldl' go ((Start, 0), []) >>> snd >>> reverse
  where
    go :: (PosState, [Positioned Token]) -> RawToken -> (PosState, [Positioned Token])</code></pre>
<p>So, we're folding from the left, and the accumulator will hold the current position information,
as well as a list of tokens we're producing. After the fold is done, we discard this position state,
but keep the tokens we produced. We produce a new token by adding it the front of the list, so we
want to <em>reverse</em> this order after we're finished.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] <strong>Note:</strong>
We use <code>foldl'</code> here, the strict version of <code>foldl</code>, since this is better for memory consumption.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before we define <code>go</code>, we need a little helper function <code>eat</code>:</p>
<pre><code>eat :: PosState -> RawToken -> (PosState, Maybe (Positioned Token))</code></pre>
<p><code>eat</code> will take in the current position information, and a raw token, and then
adjust the current position. It may also produce a token with position information,
when we come across an actual token, and not one of the extra whitespace or comment
tokens.</p>
<p>The implementation looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>    eat :: PosState -> RawToken -> (PosState, Maybe (Positioned Token))
    eat (pos, col) = \case
      Newline -> ((Start, 0), Nothing)
      Comment _ -> ((Start, 0), Nothing)
      Blankspace s -> ((pos, col + length s), Nothing)
      NormalToken t s ->
        let token = Positioned t pos col
        in ((Middle, col + length s), Just token)</code></pre>
<p>When we see a newline, regardless of what position we had earlier, the new position will be at the first column,
at the start of the next line.</p>
<p>A comment acts in the same way, since a comment is effectively like a new line, in terms of positioning.</p>
<p>When we see blank space, we advance the current column, while keeping
but our position at the start or middle of a line is left unchanged. If we were previously
at the start of a line, and then see some blank space, we're still at the start of the line,
since we haven't seen a "real" token yet.</p>
<p>When we see an actual token, we're going to produce that token, along with the current position information.
We then adjust the position information to now be in the middle of that line, and
we move the column forward based on how long the string contents of that token were.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] <strong>Note:</strong>
This is the reason why we had to include the raw string of each token. We needed
to be able to adjust the position information using the length of that token.</p></blockquote>
<p>With that done, the implementation of <code>go</code> is straightforward:</p>
<pre><code>    go :: (PosState, [Positioned Token]) -> RawToken -> (PosState, [Positioned Token])
    go (p, acc) raw =
      let (p', produced) = eat p raw
      in (p', maybeToList produced <> acc)</code></pre>
<p>We adjust the position information according to <code>eat</code>, and add a token to our accumulator
if <code>eat</code> happened to produce one.</p>
<p>Alrighty, now we have a little function to produce the position information
for our tokens, all we need is to make an algorithm that uses all of this
information to insert braces and semicolons in the right places!</p>
<h2>A Stateful Algorithm</h2>
<p>The algorithm we're going to be working on is an imperative one.
The idea is that we'll be iterating over the positioned tokens, while
keeping track of some bits of state, and then yielding tokens as we go.
In response to the position information, we might modify our current state,
or yield some extra semicolon or brace tokens. We also want
to yield all of the original tokens from the source code.</p>
<h3>Layouts</h3>
<p>The first thing we need to keep track of are the <em>layouts</em></p>
<pre><code>data Layout = Explicit | Implicit Int</code></pre>
<p>We distinguish between <code>Explicit</code> layouts, which are created by the user
with <code>{}</code>, and <code>Implicit</code> layouts, which are inferred based on whitespace.</p>
<p>Let's say we have some code like:</p>
<pre><code>let {
  x = 3
} in x</code></pre>
<p>When we see a <code>{</code>, we've entered an <code>Explicit</code> layout, and we need to keep track of this information,
because we will <em>not</em> be inserting any semicolons while we remain in this layout,
and we'll also need an explicit closing brace.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we have:</p>
<pre><code>let
  x = 3
in x</code></pre>
<p>then this is an <code>Implicit</code> layout, in fact <code>Implicit 2</code>, since the (zero-based) column
where the layout is at is <code>2</code>. This number matters, as we've seen before.
This is because:</p>
<pre><code>let
  x = 3
  y = 2
in x + y</code></pre>
<p>has a very different meaning from</p>
<pre><code>let
  x = 3
    y = 2
in x + y</code></pre>
<p>The former should see a semicolon inserted between the two definitions, whereas
the second will have us end up with <code>x = 3 y = 2</code>, as if they were on one line.
Syntactically, this will get rejected by our parser, but our lexer isn't going
to bat an eye yet.</p>
<p>We also want to be able to nest layouts, like this:</p>
<pre><code>let {
  x = let
    y = 3
  in y
} in x</code></pre>
<p>To do this, we'll be keeping a <em>stack</em> of layouts.
This will allow us to push and pop layouts as we enter and exit them.</p>
<h3>Expecting Layouts</h3>
<p>Another rule we mentioned in passing before is that <code>let</code>, <code>where</code> and <code>of</code>
are places where a layout can start. For example, when you have:</p>
<pre><code>let
  x = 2
in x</code></pre>
<p>After seeing <code>let</code>, we need to keep our eyes peeled for the next token, since that token
might trigger the start of a new implicit layout. The column where that token is
positioned becomes the column for that new layout as well.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we see a <code>{</code> after a <code>let</code>, that indicates that
we're not going to be starting an implicit layout, in which case
the indentation of that <code>{</code> doesn't matter at all.</p>
<p>We'll need to keep track of whether or not we're expecting a layout.
When we see <code>let</code>, <code>where</code> or <code>of</code>,
we'll set that to true, and then set it back once we've found the next token.</p>
<h3>The Full State</h3>
<p>The final thing we'll need, mainly for convenience, is a way to yield tokens.
Since we might want to yield extra tokens at certain points, it'd be nice to
have a way to modify the state to have an extra few tokens in its "output buffer".
We'll have a <code>[Token]</code>, and then use <code>:</code> to add new items. Once we've
traversed all of the positioned tokens, we can reverse this list, and return it,
and this will become the final output for the lexer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] <strong>Note:</strong>
We have to reverse the list since we add new tokens by putting them at the front
of the list, but the later we add a token, the later we want it to appear in the
output as well.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, our full state looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>data LayoutState = LayoutState
  { layouts :: [Layout],
    tokens :: [Token],
    expectingLayout :: Bool
  }</code></pre>
<p><code>layouts</code> is the stack of layouts we mentioned earlier, <code>expectingLayout</code> the flag
for <code>let</code>, <code>where</code>, and <code>of</code>, and <code>tokens</code> is the "output buffer" we've just talked about.
Our code will be inspecting this state, and modifying it, as it scans through
the positioned tokens we feed it.</p>
<h2>Contextual Computation</h2>
<p>In this section, we have our first use of Monad Transformers to
create a little context, or DSL, in which to do some kind of operation.
We'll be seeing plenty more of these throughout the rest of this series, so I think
it's a good idea to explain the general idea here. If you're already familiar
with some of the practical applications of Monad Transformers and
the <code>mtl</code> library, then feel free to skim, or skip over this section.</p>
<p>In normal Haskell code, you're just working with plain old values, and
function application. When you add some definitions with <code>let</code>, say:</p>
<pre><code>let x = f a b c
    y = g a b c
in x + y</code></pre>
<p>There's no code "in between" those two definitions. The order in which we
defined things doesn't matter. This is somewhat obvious,
but consider a slightly different version of this code:</p>
<pre><code>do
x <- f a b c
y <- g a b c
return (x + y)</code></pre>
<p>This bit of code is quite similar to the first version, but something very important
has changed: we're now in a do block. Because we're in such a block,
it becomes important not only to consider each line, but also the order in which
the lines occur, as well as what kind of Monad, or <em>context</em> the <code>do</code> block is for.</p>
<p>What <code>do</code> enables us to go from strictly pure computations, to computations
in a given context, or augmented with some kind of extra capability.
One of the contexts we used recently was <code>Maybe</code>. <code>Maybe</code> allows us to do some computation
with the possibility of failure. <code>do</code> does the job of
sequencing together all of the code, using the <code>>>=</code> function that <code>Maybe</code> implements.
In the above example, if <code>f</code> were to return <code>Nothing</code>, then the result of the whole block
would be <code>Nothing</code>.</p>
<p>There are other kinds of contexts that will be useful to us quite soon.
One example would be <code>State s</code>. This allows us to have some computations
that manipulate some state of type <code>s</code>. We can query for the current state,
and also modify it. It's as if we embedded a little imperative DSL into our Haskell code.
Of course, <code>State s</code> is essentially sugar for <code>s -> (a, s)</code>, and <code>>>=</code> does the drudge
work of passing the correct state around as new states are returned. No mutation
actually <strong>happens</strong>, but plenty of mutation is certainly <strong>expressed</strong>
in the DSL provided by <code>State s</code>.</p>
<p>Where transformers come into play is in their ability to let us <em>combine</em>
multiple contexts together. If we want the ability to fail with an error,
and to manipulate a given state, we'll need to combine both <code>State s</code> and
<code>Either e</code>. This is where things like <code>StateT</code> and <code>ExceptT</code>
are useful.</p>
<h2>LayoutM</h2>
<p>We can use these raw combinations directly, or encapsulate them behind
a <code>newtype</code>. We'll be using <code>newtypes</code> later on. The idea behind wrapping
a stack of transformers behind a <code>newtype</code> is that the DSL we want to provide is
quite different than that of the different transformers. The transformers
are just an implementation detail for the little imperative language
we want to embed.</p>
<p>In this case, we'll be using a "naked" stack, but later on we'll mostly be using <code>newtype</code>
stacks.</p>
<p>We'll be needing a context / stack for our algorithm, which we'll aptly call, <code>LayoutM</code>:</p>
<pre><code>type LayoutM a = ExceptT LexerError (State LayoutState) a</code></pre>
<p>We're combining two Monads here, <code>Except LexerError</code>, which allows to fail with errors
of type <code>LexerError</code>, and <code>State LayoutState</code>, which allows us to inspect
and manipulate the <code>LayoutState</code> type that we defined earlier.</p>
<p>We can go ahead and create a little helper that will run a computation in <code>LayoutM</code>,
returning the tokens it produced, in the right order:</p>
<pre><code>runLayoutM :: LayoutM a -> Either LexerError [Token]
runLayoutM =
  runExceptT >>> (`runState` LayoutState [] [] True) >>> \case
    (Left e, _) -> Left e
    (Right _, LayoutState _ ts _) -> Right (reverse ts)</code></pre>
<p>The idea behind running the stack is that you need to unwrap the layers
from outside to inside. So first we unwrap the <code>ExceptT</code> layer,
and then unwrap the <code>State</code> layer. We need to provide a starting state, of course.
That starting state indicates that no layouts have been seen yet, no tokens have been produced,
but we <em>are</em> expecting a layout at the start of a file!</p>
<p>Finally, we'll look at the output result, which will be <code>(Either LexerError a, LayoutState)</code>,
We don't care about the output itself, only the tokens in the state,
which we need to reverse, as explained before.</p>
<p>We expect a layout at the start of a file, because our source
code will consist of multiple definitions:</p>
<pre><code>x :: Int
x = y

y :: Int
y = 2</code></pre>
<p>and we want to be able to infer the semicolons between the different statements,
and thus the braces surrounding all of the code.</p>
<h2>Basic Operations</h2>
<p>As a bit of a warmup, let's write a few of the fundamental operations
we'll be using. These make up a bit more of the "DSL"
we're making with <code>LayoutM</code>.</p>
<h3>Yielding Tokens</h3>
<p>The first operation we need is the ability to produce a token:</p>
<pre><code>yieldToken :: Token -> LayoutM ()
yieldToken t = modify' (\s -> s {tokens = t : tokens s})</code></pre>
<p>We modify the current state, producing a new state with the token
at the front of our output buffer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] <strong>Note:</strong>
We use <code>modify'</code>, the strict version of <code>modify</code>, since we have no
use for laziness in our state. We're going to consume it completely,
and so it's better to avoid creating needless thunks.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Layout Operations</h3>
<p>We'll be needing an operation to a push a new layout onto the stack:</p>
<pre><code>pushLayout :: Layout -> LayoutM ()
pushLayout l = modify' (\s -> s {layouts = l : layouts s})</code></pre>
<p>This one operates in the same way as <code>yieldToken</code>, except on <code>layouts</code>,
instead of <code>tokens</code>.</p>
<p>And then we'll need an operation to remove a layout from the stack:</p>
<pre><code>popLayout :: LayoutM ()
popLayout = modify' (\s -> s {layouts = drop 1 (layouts s)})</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] <strong>Note:</strong>
We use <code>drop 1</code>, instead of <code>tail</code>, since we want don't want to do anything
if the stack of layouts is already empty.</p></blockquote>
<p>We also want to be able to inspect the current layout:</p>
<pre><code>currentLayout :: LayoutM (Maybe Layout)
currentLayout = gets layouts |> fmap listToMaybe</code></pre>
<p>If <code>layouts</code> ends up being empty, then we'll end up returning <code>Nothing</code> here.</p>
<p>An immediate application of this little helper is a function:</p>
<pre><code>compareIndentation :: Int -> LayoutM Ordering</code></pre>
<p>Which tells us whether or not an implicit layout starting at a given column would
be considered less than (<code>LT</code>), equal to (<code>EQ</code>), or greater than (<code>GT</code>)
than the current layout:</p>
<pre><code>compareIndentation :: Int -> LayoutM Ordering
compareIndentation col =
  let cmp Nothing = GT
      cmp (Just Explicit) = GT
      cmp (Just (Implicit n)) = compare col n
   in fmap cmp currentLayout</code></pre>
<p>The idea is that any implicit layout is greater than no layout at all,
or an explicit layout. On the other hand, if we have another implicit layout,
we need to compare the columns. We'll be seeing how we use this comparison soon enough.</p>
<h2>The Algorithm Itself</h2>
<p>Alrighty, we've built in the background knowledge and some of the basic building
blocks to actually start dissecting the layout algorithm itself. Here's what it looks like:</p>
<pre><code>layout :: [Positioned Token] -> Either LexerError [Token]
layout inputs =
  runLayoutM <| do
    mapM_ step inputs
    closeImplicitLayouts
  where
    ...</code></pre>
<p>So <code>layout</code> takes in the positioned tokens we made earlier, and then
converts them into a list of normal tokens, including the generated semicolons
and braces. We might also fail with a <code>LexerError</code>.</p>
<p>What we do is run a layout action, which loops over the inputs using the <code>step</code> function,
which will modify the state, and produce tokens, and then we have a function <code>closeImplicitLayouts</code>.
The idea behind this operation is that at the end of a file, if any implicit layouts are still open,
we need to generate the explicit closing braces for them.</p>
<p>For example, if we have something like:</p>
<pre><code>x = y
  where
    y = z
      where
        z = 3</code></pre>
<p>Then we want to end up with:</p>
<pre><code>{
x = y where {
  y = z where {
    z = 3
  }
}
}</code></pre>
<p>So we need to generate all of those closing braces when we reach
the end of the token stream. Thankfully, since we keep a stack of the layouts
we've entered, we'll have 3 pending implicit layouts: one for the start of the file,
and 2 others for the <code>where</code>s.</p>
<p>So, we have the following definition:</p>
<pre><code>    closeImplicitLayouts :: LayoutM ()
    closeImplicitLayouts =
      currentLayout >>= \case
        Nothing -> return ()
        Just Explicit -> throwError UnmatchedLayout
        Just (Implicit _) -> do
          yieldToken CloseBrace
          popLayout
          closeImplicitLayouts</code></pre>
<p>We loop until there are no layouts left on the stack. If at any point,
we see an explicit layout, then that's an error. It means that we have something like:</p>
<pre><code>{
x = 2</code></pre>
<p>and we <em>never</em> close explicit braces ourselves. We have an unmatched <code>{</code>
by the time we're at the end of the file, and that's an error.</p>
<p>Whenever we see an implicit layout, we generate the necessary closing <code>}</code>,
and then remove that layout from the stack.</p>
<p>Another helper we'll need is <code>startsLayout</code>:</p>
<pre><code>    startsLayout :: Token -> Bool
    startsLayout = (`elem` [Let, Where, Of])</code></pre>
<p>This encodes the fact we've talked about a few times, where <code>let</code>, <code>where</code>,
and <code>of</code> are the tokens that start a layout.</p>
<h3>The Step</h3>
<p>The crux of the algorithm is the <code>step</code> function, which contains all of
the core rules behind how layouts work in our subset of Haskell:</p>
<pre><code>    step :: Positioned Token -> LayoutM ()
    step (Positioned t linePos col) = do
      expectingLayout' <- gets expectingLayout
      case t of
        CloseBrace -> closeExplicitLayout
        OpenBrace | expectingLayout' -> startExplicitLayout
        _
          | startsLayout t -> modify' (\s -> s {expectingLayout = True})
          | expectingLayout' -> startImplicitLayout col
          | linePos == Start -> continueImplicitLayout col
          | otherwise -> return ()
      yieldToken t</code></pre>
<p>In certain situations, whether or not we're expecting a layout matters,
so we first retrieve that from the state.</p>
<p>Regardless of how we process that token, we will add it to the output
buffer afterwards, hence the <code>yieldToken t</code> at the end of the <code>case</code>.
We want to look at the token to decide what extra handling needs to be done though.</p>
<p>If we see <code>}</code>, that means that the user is intending to close
a layout that they created explicitly using a <code>{</code>, and we handle that case
in the <code>closeExplicitLayout</code> operation.</p>
<p>If we see a <code>{</code>, <em>and</em> we're at a point in the stream where a layout can be started,
because we're after <code>let</code>, <code>where</code> or <code>of</code>, then we start an explicit layout, using
<code>startExplicitLayout</code>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the token itself doesn't matter, but other properties and conditions do.</p>
<p>If that token starts a layout, then we need to set this flag to true in our state.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if we're expecting a layout, then we should start an implicit layout
at the column where this token appears.</p>
<p>So if we have:</p>
<pre><code>let
  x =</code></pre>
<p>After seeing <code>let</code>, we're now expecting a layout. Then when we see <code>x</code>, we decide
to start an implicit layout at column 2.</p>
<p>If we're not expecting a layout, and we see the first token on a given line, then we're
continuing a layout that already exists, knowing that whatever layout we're continuing
is at the column <code>col</code>. This actually handles a few different cases, as we'll see.</p>
<h3>Closing Explicit Layouts</h3>
<p>For <code>closeExplicitLayout</code>, the idea is that after seeing <code>}</code>, this
must close an explicit layout started with <code>{</code>, and this layout must be
at the top of the stack. The reason for this is that we don't allow <code>}</code>
to close implicit layouts itself.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>{
let
  x = 2 }</code></pre>
<p>this would be an error. This is because we start an implicit layout after
the <code>x</code>, and <code>}</code> isn't allowed to close that implicit layout itself.</p>
<p>Concretely, we have:</p>
<pre><code>    closeExplicitLayout :: LayoutM ()
    closeExplicitLayout =
      currentLayout >>= \case
        Just Explicit -> popLayout
        _ -> throwError (Unexpected '}')</code></pre>
<p>If the current layout is explicit, that's what we expect, and we remove
it from the stack, since the <code>}</code> has closed it. Otherwise, we throw an error,
for the reasons mentioned above.</p>
<h3>Starting Explicit Layouts</h3>
<p>This is sort of the reverse operation. We need to push an explicit
layout for the opening <code>{</code> we've just seen onto the stack. We also
need to indicate that we're no longer expecting a layout, since the <code>{</code>
starts the layout we were expecting:</p>
<pre><code>    startExplicitLayout :: LayoutM ()
    startExplicitLayout = do
      modify' (\s -> s {expectingLayout = False})
      pushLayout Explicit</code></pre>
<h3>Starting Implicit Layouts</h3>
<p>For <code>startImplicitLayout</code>, let's have a look at the code, and explain what's going
on with some examples afterwards. This function will be called when we've seen our
first token (that isn't a <code>{</code> or a <code>}</code>) after seeing a layout starting token.</p>
<pre><code>    startImplicitLayout :: Int -> LayoutM ()
    startImplicitLayout col = do
      modify' (\s -> s {expectingLayout = False})
      compareIndentation col >>= \case
        GT -> do
          yieldToken OpenBrace
          pushLayout (Implicit col)
        _ -> do
          yieldToken OpenBrace
          yieldToken CloseBrace
          continueImplicitLayout col</code></pre>
<p>Now, regardless of how we handle things, we're no longer expecting a layout
after this is over. We'll have handled things, one way or another.</p>
<p>What happens next depends on how the column we saw this token at compares with the current indentation.</p>
<p>If we're strictly further indented, then we start a new implicit layout, and push the <code>{</code> token
that goes with it.
Otherwise, we push a complete, but empty layout with a <code>{</code> and a matching <code>}</code> token, and then
use <code>continueImplicitLayout</code>.</p>
<p>This catches the case where we have something like:</p>
<pre><code>let
  x = 2 where
  y = 3
in x + y</code></pre>
<p>After the <code>where</code>, we are indeed expecting a layout, and <code>y</code> at column 2 is the token we expect to
handle that fact. But, since <code>y = 3</code> is at the same level of indentation as <code>x = 2</code>, it
belongs to the layout started after <code>let</code>! Because of this, this <code>where</code> block is actually empty,
and the tokens we produce are:</p>
<pre><code>let {
  x = 2 where {};
  y = 3
} in x + y</code></pre>
<p>Now, if the <code>y = 3</code> had been further indented:</p>
<pre><code>let
  x = 2 where
    y = 3
in x</code></pre>
<p>Then this would need to produce:</p>
<pre><code>let
  x = 2 where { y = 3 }
in x</code></pre>
<h2>Continuing Implicit Layout</h2>
<p>So <code>continueImplicitLayout</code> handles the case where we have some token at the start of a line,
or after a layout token, that needs to continue the current implicit layout in some way. Another
case we'll handle here is <em>closing</em> that implicit layout automatically.</p>
<p>Layouts are closed when we see a token that's less indented. For example:</p>
<pre><code>x = y
  where
    y = 2

z = 3</code></pre>
<p>The <code>where</code> layout closes when we see <code>z = 3</code> indented less than <code>y = 2</code>, giving us:</p>
<pre><code>{
x = y where { y = 2 };

z = 3
}</code></pre>
<p>Concretely, we have:</p>
<pre><code>    continueImplicitLayout :: Int -> LayoutM ()
    continueImplicitLayout col = do
      closeFurtherLayouts
      compareIndentation col >>= \case
        EQ -> yieldToken Semicolon
        _ -> return ()
      where
        closeFurtherLayouts =
          compareIndentation col >>= \case
            LT -> do
              yieldToken CloseBrace
              popLayout
              closeFurtherLayouts
            _ -> return ()</code></pre>
<p>The first thing we do is close every implicit layout that we're strictly
below, for teh reasons we just went over. To close them we emit a <code>}</code>,
and then pop the layout off of the stack.</p>
<p>Then we check whether or not there's a layout matching our indentation <em>exactly</em>,
in which case we need to emit a semicolon.</p>
<p>This is so that we have the semicolons in something like:</p>
<pre><code>let
  x = 2
  y = 3
  z = 4
in x + y + z</code></pre>
<p>With this way of doing things, we'll be generating the semicolon necessary between
the tokens when we see them continuing the layout, so we have something like:</p>
<pre><code>let {
  x = 2
  ;y = 3
  ;z = 4
} in x + y + z</code></pre>
<p>The rest of the logic we had earlier makes it so that by the time we
call <code>continueImplicitLayout</code>, we know that there's some other token
before us, and we need a semicolon as a separator. That token will have
use <code>startImplicitLayout</code> itself, producing the layout we find ourselves in.</p>
<h3>Glue Code</h3>
<p>We can now glue all of this together, and produce a lexer function that does all of these positioning rules:</p>
<pre><code>lexer :: String -> Either LexerError [Token]
lexer input =
  runLexer rawLexer input >>= (fst >>> position >>> layout)</code></pre>
<h1>Some Examples</h1>
<p>And that's it! We're done! We've made a complete lexer for our subset of Haskell,
handling whitespace in all of its glory. For the sake of completeness, let's see how it works
in some examples.</p>
<p>As a reminder, we can run our lexer using:</p>
<pre><code>cabal run haskell-in-haskell -- lex file.hs</code></pre>
<p>First, if we just have some basic definitions:</p>
<pre><code>x = 1

y = 2

z = 3</code></pre>
<p>We see that the whole thing is surrounded in braces, and semicolons are inserted
at the right spots:</p>
<pre><code>[ OpenBrace
, LowerName "x"
, Equal
, IntLit 1
, Semicolon
, LowerName "y"
, Equal
, IntLit 2
, Semicolon
, LowerName "z"
, Equal
, IntLit 3
, CloseBrace
]</code></pre>
<p>If we have a simple nested let:</p>
<pre><code>z =
  let
    x = let
      y = 3
    in y
  in x</code></pre>
<pre><code>[ OpenBrace
, LowerName "z"
, Equal
, Let
, OpenBrace
, LowerName "x"
, Equal
, Let
, OpenBrace
, LowerName "y"
, Equal
, IntLit 3
, CloseBrace
, Semicolon
, In
, LowerName "y"
, CloseBrace
, In
, LowerName "x"
, CloseBrace
]</code></pre>
<p>If you've followed along so far, congratulations, I hope that wasn't too much typing!
You can have quite a bit of fun trying out different programs, and seeing
what output your lexer produces!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] <strong>Note:</strong>
One rule of Haskell's layout algorithm that we've omitted says that
if you encounter a parse error, and you have an implicit layout
on the stack, then you should try inserting a <code>}</code>, and then resume parsing.</p>
<p>This rule is a pain to implement, and we've left it out to vastly simplify
the structure of our parsing. With this rule in place, you can't truly separate
the two phases.</p>
<p>While I think the rule is very ugly, it does make so some extra things do parse
correctly. Keep that in mind if some examples fail to lex.</p></blockquote>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>So, this post was longer than I expected it to be! Hopefully I did a decent job
of introducing lexing, as well as the lexer for our subset of Haskell. I hope that
the layout rules are much clearer now that you've actually had to implement all of their details.
I've tried to organize the rules in a way that's reasonably understandable.</p>
<p>As always, <a href=https://github.com/cronokirby/haskell-in-haskell/tree/part-2>here's</a>.
the full code for this part.</p>
<p>There's <a href=https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/syntax-iso.html>a section in the Haskell '98 report</a>
that talks about Haskell syntax, and the layout rules, in particular. This might be an interesting
read, and you can contrast the way they define rules there with the imperative algorithm
we've set up here.</p>
<p><a href=https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html>Crafting Interpreters</a> is another fun
and very approachable read if you want to know more about lexing.</p>
<p>In the next post, we'll be going over parsing! By the end of that post, we'll have gone from
a simple stream of tokens to a full syntax tree for our subset of Haskell!</p><section class="footnotes">
