<p>This is a post about how different languages
handle the concept of <em>interfaces</em>. We'll go over the classical
<em>OO</em> way of handling them, with <em>Java</em>, to the more recent
approaches of languages like <em>Rust</em>, as well as others in between.</p><!--more-->
<h1>Why do we want interfaces?</h1>
<p>The problem interfaces address is <em>polymorphism</em>.
Polymorphic code can work with different types of things
in a flexible way. In practice this means functions
that can accept different types, and work differently based on those
types.</p>
<p>For example, we might have a function that can print out results
to a file or directly to the terminal.</p>
<p>Polymorphism lets us write more reusable code. One function
can operate on many types without having to be rewritten for each of them.</p>
<p>Functions that use only an interface, instead of all the implementation
details of a type, are easier to understand. For example, instead of
depending on all of a file's operations, we only care about using it as another
output stream. This allows our functions to worry
about less things, and get closer to having a <em>single responsibility</em>.</p>
<h1>Classical Interfaces</h1>
<p>Interfaces in Java are a variant of <em>inheritance</em>, so
let's look over how that works first.</p>
<h2>Inheritance</h2>
<p>Java has <em>classes</em>, and these have <em>methods</em>.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>class Rectangle {
  private int height;
  private int width;

  public Rectangle(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }

  public int area() {
    return height * width;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a class, with two <em>fields</em>, a <em>constructor</em>, and a method
that makes use of both of those fields.</p>
<p>We can create a new <em>instance</em> of this class, and call its methods
as follows:</p>
<pre><code>var rectangle = new Rectangle(3, 4);
System.out.println(rectangle.area());</code></pre>
<p>This program prints out <code>12</code>, because we call this rectangle's methods using
the data contained in its fields.</p>
<p>We can also make new classes which inherit from another;
for example:</p>
<pre><code>class Square extends Rectangle {
  public Square(width) {
    super(width, width);
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>This class can be used like this:</p>
<pre><code>var square = new Square(3);
System.out.println(square.area());</code></pre>
<p>This program prints out <code>9</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Square</code> class inherits all the methods and their implementations
from its parent class <code>Rectangle</code>, and can use its parent's constructor.
This means that it already has all of <code>Rectangle</code>'s methods and their
implementations from the start.</p>
<p>Classes can also change the implementation of certain methods. This
is called <em>overriding</em> in Java.</p>
<pre><code>  @Override
  public int height() {
    // new behavior
  }</code></pre>
<h2>Abstract Classes</h2>
<p>Java also has a feature called <em>abstract classes</em>.</p>
<p>Abstract classes have one big difference from normal classes:
they can choose not to provide an implementation for a given method.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>abstract class Shape {
  abstract int height();

  int heightSquared() {
    var h = height();
    return h * h;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>We've left the <code>height</code> method abstract. We can't actually create
instances of the <code>Shape</code> class. Instead, we need to extend the class
with another, and then we can create instances of that <em>subclass</em>.</p>
<h2>Interfaces</h2>
<p>Now that we've seen classes, and then abstract classes, we
can move on to interfaces, as implemented in Java.</p>
<p>An interface is essentially an abstract class, where
all the methods are abstract.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>interface ShapeLike {
  int area();
}</code></pre>
<p>We can then have different classes that implement this interface:</p>
<pre><code>class Rectangle implements ShapeLike {
  int area() {
    return width * height;
  }
}

class Square implements ShapeLike {
  int area() {
    return width * width;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>This can be used for polymorphism, by declaring a function that accepts
an interface instead of a specific type:</p>
<pre><code>class ShapeUtils {
   static int areaSquared(ShapeLike shape) {
     var a = shape.area();
     return a * a;
   }
}</code></pre>
<p>(We make a class with a <em>static</em> method because Java doesn't like free functions).</p>
<p>One key thing to notice here is that each class has to explicitly
declare that it implements a given interface. There's no way to make
an old class implement a new interface.</p>
<p>Java has many other ways of implementing polymorphism through
inheritence, from subclassing to abstract classes to interfaces.
All of these have allow a function to accept a given
type without knowing whether that argument is of that exact type,
or a given subtype. When accepting an interface, a function can only use
the methods that interface provides, and is oblivious to the other details the
various classes implementing that interface may have.</p>
<h1>Middle Ground: Go</h1>
<p>The main difference between <em>Go</em> and Java is that in Go, implementing
an interface is implicit, whereas in Java, this is explicit.</p>
<p>Continuing with our geometry examples, in Go we might have code
that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>package main

import "fmt"

type Shape interface {
  area() int
}

type Square struct {
  width int
}

func (s Square) area() int {
  return s.width * s.width
}

func main() {
  var s Shape
  s = Square{width: 3}
  fmt.Println(s.area())
}</code></pre>
<p>(This is actually a complete Go program that can be run, and prints out <code>9</code>)</p>
<p>The first part of this program declares a new interface type, named <code>Shape</code>.
This interface is defined by the method <code>area</code>. With the way interfaces
work in Go, any type that has a method named <code>area</code> with the right type signature
can be used as that interface. Later on in the program, we assign a value
of type <code>Square</code> to a variable of type <code>Shape</code>. This is allowed because
<code>Square</code> has a method with the right name and types.</p>
<p>One downside of Java's interfaces is that old types cannot implement
new interfaces. If we notice a behavior we want to abstract over,
we can't make it work with existing types. Because Go has implicit interfaces,
if we notice that multiple types already have a given method, we can abstract
over that. We can create a function that accepts any type that has a given set
of methods by using interfaces.</p>
<h1>Rust's Traits</h1>
<p>Rust's version of interfaces is called <em>traits</em>. These
traits function quite similarly to <em>Haskell</em>'s <em>typeclasses</em>.</p>
<p>The main difference between Rust and the other two examples
we've seen so far is that in Rust, traits are implemented
explicitly, but can be implemented for existing types.</p>
<p>Let's look at an example:</p>
<pre><code>trait Shape {
  fn area(&self) -> i32;
}

struct Square {
  width: i32
}

impl Shape for Square {
   fn area(&self) -> i32 {
     width * width
   }
}</code></pre>
<p>We've seen a similar example a few times. This is very similar
to the Go version, except that instead of implementing
an <code>area</code> method in the struct (which we can do in Rust), and
then having the interface implementation be implicit, we have
to explicitly implement that interface.</p>
<p>One advantage of explicit implementation is that the Rust
compiler can warn us if we incorrectly implement an interface.
In Java a similar thing happens as well.</p>
<p>Because the implementation block is separate from the declaration
of the type itself, we can implement a trait for a type that already
exists. This is very useful, because we can identify abstractions at any time.</p>
<p>There are two "guidelines" of sorts that constrain this a little bit.
We should try and put a trait implementation either</p>
<ul><li>In the same file as the declaration of a <em>trait</em></li><li>In the same file as the declaration of a <em>type</em></li></ul>
<p>For existing types, we have to put the implementation next
to the trait, since we don't have access to the original file.</p>
<p>For types we think up after having created the interface, we can
implement that interface next to the type.</p>
<h1>Interface Matrix</h1>
<p>We can divide up the design space we've gone over so far like so:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Language</th>
<th>Existing Types</th>
<th>Explicit</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Java</th>
<th>No</th>
<th>Yes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Go</th>
<th>Yes</th>
<th>No</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Rust</th>
<th>Yes</th>
<th>Yes</th>
</tr>
</table>
<p>I don't know of a language with some kind of interface construct
which doesn't work with existing types, but has implicit implementation.
I think that this may not even be possible. If the implementation is
implicit, then it will pick up the methods that already
exist for certain types.</p>
<h1>My Opinions</h1>
<p>Now we come to the meat of the post: why I think Rust's position
in the design space is the best.</p>
<h3>Traits work with existing types</h3>
<p>This is the most important aspect of traits in my view.</p>
<p>By being able to implement new traits for old types,
you can discover and work on abstractions independently
of other types. This allows you to work much more flexibly
with other people's code, since you can implement
your own abstraction layer without having to write a
bunch of wrapper types.</p>
<h3>Traits are still explicit</h3>
<p>In general, I prefer explicit behavior to implicit
behavior.</p>
<p>One advantage of trait implementations being explicit
is that it's easy to tell that a type implements a trait
correctly. In Rust, if your implementation uses the wrong
name or method type, then you'll catch it then and there.
In Go, you'll only catch this once you try and assign
this type to a given interface.</p>
<p>The two guidelines for where trait implementations
should lie keeps things much more orderly. It's very easy
to know what existing types a trait decided to provide
implementations for, since they all have to be located
next to the trait itself.</p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Different languages have different ways of implementing
interface-like concepts. The main axes in the design space
are explicit vs implicit implementation, and working
with existing types or not.</p>
<p>Rust's position of working with existing types in an explicit
way is the best, in my opinion.</p><section class="footnotes">
