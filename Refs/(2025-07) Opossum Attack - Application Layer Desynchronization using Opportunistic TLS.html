<h1>Abstract</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Many protocols, like HTTP, FTP, POP3, and SMTP, were origi-
nally designed as synchronous plaintext protocols -- commands
and data are sent in the clear, and the client waits for the response
to a pending request before sending the next one. Later, two main
solutions were introduced to retrofit these protocols with TLS
protection. (1) Implicit TLS: Designate a new, well-known TCP
port for each protocol-over-TLS, and start with TLS immediately.
(2) Opportunistic TLS: Keep the original well-known port and start
with the plaintext protocol, then switch to TLS in response to a
command like STARTTLS.
In this work, we present a novel weakness in the way TLS is
integrated into popular application layer protocols through implicit
and opportunistic TLS. This weakness breaks authentication, even
in modern TLS implementations if both implicit TLS and oppor-
tunistic TLS are supported at the same time. This authentication
flaw can then be utilized to influence the exchanged messages after
the TLS handshake from a pure MitM position.In contrast to previ-
ous attacks on opportunistic TLS, this attack class does not rely on
bugs in the implementations and only requires one of the peers to
support opportunistic TLS.
We analyze popular application layer protocols that support
opportunistic TLS regarding their vulnerability to the attack. To
demonstrate the practical impact of the attack, we analyze exploita-
tion techniques for HTTP (RFC 2817) in detail, and show four
different exploit directions. To estimate the impact of the attack on
deployed servers, we conducted a series of IPv4-wide scans over
multiple protocols and ports to check for support of opportunistic
TLS. We found that support for opportunistic TLS is still widespread
for many application protocols, with over 3 million servers support-
ing both, implicit and opportunistic TLS at the same time. In the
case of HTTP, we found 20,121 servers that support opportunistic
HTTP across 35 ports, with 2,268 of these servers also supporting
HTTPS and 539 using the same domain names for implicit HTTPS,
presenting an exploitable scenario.</p></blockquote><section class="footnotes">
