<p>The sad life of a carnival magician and hustler, Stanley. From his humble beginnings in the big tent, to his time as a mentalist, to being a scammer, and getting scammed in turn.</p>
<p>This is very much a story-focused book. The prose does a good job at carrying the story forwards, but doesn't shine on its own, apart from a few moments. At the end, the frenetic energy of the main character is portrayed quite well through the words on the page. Not that this is a weakness of the book, per se, just that the novel isn't attempting to be something literary through prose alone.</p>
<p>That said, the details around the carnival itself, and the details of the act were well researched, and the exposition was very engaging. I would have liked to see more focus on the carnival itself, which was a very unique and interesting setting, that faded into the background earlier than I would have liked.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the novel does try to act as a kind of parable. There's a practical message against betrayal. Our protagonist betrays his friends, wife, and morals, and finds himself punished for it. In some sense, this is the most classic parable of all: that of immoral actions bringing about terrible consequences. The execution and setting are quite original though.</p>
<p>The ending is also brilliant, and really ties the moral message together.</p><section class="footnotes">
