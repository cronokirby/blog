<p>I didn't like this story very much. The structure of it is 95% set up, 1% crux of the story, which is brushed over in a few paragraphs, and then 4% twist ending. I felt like I had accidentally switched TV channels right as the good part was happening, and felt confused at the ending.</p><section class="footnotes">
