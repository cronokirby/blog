<h1>Abstract</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Blind signatures play a central role in cryptographic protocols for privacy-preserving authentication and have attracted substantial attention in both theory and practice. A major line of research, dating back to the 1990s, has focused on constructing blind signatures from pairing-free groups. However, all known constructions in this setting require at least three moves of interaction between the signer and the user. These schemes treat the underlying group as a black box and rely on the random oracle in their security proofs. While computationally efficient, they suffer from the drawback that the signer must maintain state during a signing session. In contrast, round-optimal solutions are known under other assumptions and structures (e.g., RSA, lattices, and pairings), or via generic transformations such as Fischlin’s method (CRYPTO~'06), which employ non-black-box techniques.</p>
<p>This paper investigates whether the three-round barrier for pairing-free groups is inherent. We provide the first negative evidence by proving that, in a model combining the Random Oracle Model (ROM) with Maurer’s Generic Group Model, no blind signature scheme can be secure if it signs sufficiently long messages while making at most a logarithmic number of random oracle queries. Our lower-bound techniques are novel in that they address the interaction of both models (generic groups and random oracles) simultaneously.</p></blockquote><section class="footnotes">
