<p>A day in the life of an retirement home, where they try and put on a fair, is depicted. The tensions between the elderly and their younger caretakers are highlighted.</p>
<p>The characters in this novel are the most interesting part. There's a varied cast, and their interactions, especially across generations, are well depicted, and serve as a good vantage point for philosophical digression. The use of different points of view is done excellently, and does let you get into the head of the different actors quite well.</p>
<p>The descriptions are vivid, precise, and concise. At times, they feel a bit sparse though. I would have liked a bit more energy and color to the scenes, which can feel a bit undressed.</p>
<p>There's a bit of amateurishness to <em>Updike's</em> first novel, but it's not to the point where you would suspect it to be a debut. The plot is weak, the themes are not quite fully developed, and there are loose threads in the world-building. These issues get ironed out by the time of the subsequent novel <a href="/Refs/(1960) Rabbit, Run.html">(1960) Rabbit, Run</a>. It's interesting to see how <em>Updike</em> improves even after so little time.</p><section class="footnotes">
