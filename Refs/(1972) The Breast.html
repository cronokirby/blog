<p><em>Philip Roth</em>'s take on <em>Kafka's</em> <em>Die Verwandlung (The Metamorphosis)</em>, wherein the protagonist finds himself transformed not into a human-sized cockroach, but a human-sized breast.</p>
<p>A very comical story, with the typical sexual obsessions that Roth's protagonists tend to have, especially in this era (<a href="/Refs/(1969) Portnoy's Complaint.html">Portnoy's Complaint</a> was only written a few years back). The neuroticisms of the main character are on full display, their plight against their absurd condition reaches pathetic lows, all of which is portrayed in a comic way. The story is genuinely quite funny, and very engaging.</p>
<p>The story has a surprisingly compelling narrative arc about coming to terms with grief, and with "tragedy". Our main character goes through different stages of grief over their transformation: shock, depression, denial, madness, peace. These psychological states are captured quite well through an emotive first person narration.</p>
<p>You could transpose the grief the main character overcomes to being about, e.g. finding themselves paralyzed---rather than finding themselves comically transformed into a human breast---and it would play as a very serious story, sold exclusively at the finest airport kiosks across the country.</p>
<p>The length and pacing of this story are perfect as well. Overall, an excellently executed piece of writing, with a mainly comic, but also, at times, philosophical appeal.</p><section class="footnotes">
