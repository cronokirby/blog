<p>A story about the tribulations of an aspiring socialite, Lily Bart, in turn-of-the-century <em>New York</em>. Her position is made especially precarious by her personal lack of wealth, but her being accustomed to running in the high social circles, participation in which requiring a steady stream of funds, for fancy clothes, large tips, and a gambling purse. Her dilemma lies in finding a suitor to marry: should she try and acquire a rich husband who can support her lifestyle, or should she try and escape the trappings of the socialite rat race?</p>
<p>The books reflects a lot on the dilemma, and the situation of this social class more broadly. This was interesting, and more peculiar than you might expect.</p>
<p>Like many serials, reading the book in one stretch can be a bit boring, as the end result ends up being more drawn out, with looser threads than a more edited novel would have. The language of the novel is in a particularly high register, with many emotional positions and thoughts being only loosely alluded to, even in the characters' thoughts themselves.</p><section class="footnotes">
