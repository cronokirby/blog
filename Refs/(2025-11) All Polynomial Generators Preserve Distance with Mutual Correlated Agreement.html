<h1>Abstract</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>A generator is a function that maps a random seed to a list of coefficients. We study generators that preserve distance to a linear code: the linear combination of any list of vectors using coefficients sampled by the generator has distance to the code no smaller than that of the original vectors, except for a small error. Distance preservation plays a central role in modern probabilistic proofs, and has been formalized in several ways. We study \emph{mutual correlated agreement}, the strongest known form of distance preservation.</p>
<p>We initiate the systematic study of mutual correlated agreement, aiming to characterize the class of generators with this property. Towards this, we study polynomial generators, a rich class that includes all examples of generators considered in the distance preservation literature. Our main result is that \emph{all polynomial generators guarantee mutual correlated agreement for every linear code}. This improves on prior work both in generality (the class of generators covered) and in parameters (the error bounds).</p>
<p>We additionally provide new results for the case where the linear code is a Reed--Solomon code, which is of particular interest in applications. We prove that all polynomial generators satisfy mutual correlated agreement for Reed--Solomon codes up to the Johnson bound. In particular, we improve upon the state-of-the-art by Ben-Sasson, Carmon, Ishai, Kopparty, and Saraf (FOCS 2020) and resolve a question posed by Arnon, Chiesa, Fenzi, and Yogev (Eurocrypt 2025).</p>
<p>Along the way we develop a flexible and general toolbox for mutual correlated agreement, are the first to establish distance preservation for generators that lie beyond polynomial generators.</p></blockquote><section class="footnotes">
