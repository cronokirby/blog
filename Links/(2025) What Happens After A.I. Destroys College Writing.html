<blockquote>
<p>The demise of the English paper will end a long intellectual tradition, but it's also an opportunity to reëxamine the purpose of higher education.</p></blockquote>
<p>Articles bemoaning the state of higher education post-ChatGPT are almost cliché at this point, but I found this one to stand out in its accurate portrayal of the students and professors engaged in this new reality. It's interesting to see how students lean on AI as a crutch, out-sourcing their thinking. Another phenomenon I don't see discussed as much is <a href="/Notes/Anxious AI Assistant Use.html">anxious ai assistant use</a>, in that many students reported on here use AI reflexively to the point of wasting time sucked into meaningless conversations.</p>
<p>More than other articles I've read on the topic, this really gives me the sense of us living in a new world. And where also would you get quotes from brilliant scholars such as "Honestly, yeah. I'm not tryin' to type all that. Could you tell?".</p><section class="footnotes">
