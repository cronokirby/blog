# Abstract

> The sum-check protocol is a foundational primitive in modern cryptographic proof systems, but its prover-side cost has emerged as a concrete bottleneck. This paper introduces three complementary techniques that significantly reduce sum-check proving time and memory, especially in the context of zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs).
> 
> First, for applications involving products of many multilinear polynomials, we develop a new algorithm that significantly reduces the number of field multiplications required for proving. Second, we develop a "small-value sum-check prover" algorithm. This significantly speeds up the prover in the common setting where the polynomials being summed evaluate to 64 or 32-bit integers, or to elements of a small sub-field within a larger extension field. Even outside of the small-value setting, this algorithm yields a faster "streaming prover", by which we mean a small-space algorithm that applies whenever the terms being summed can be enumerated in small space (as arises, for example, in zkVM applications). Third, we nearly eliminate prover overhead in the ubiquitous case where one factor is an equality polynomial by exploiting its decomposable tensor structure.
> 
> We implement these techniques in Jolt, a state-of-the-art zkVM, and evaluate their performance. In Jolt, we observe over an order of magnitude runtime speedup and memory reduction on the Spartan sub-protocol, and $1.7\times$ to $2.2\times$ speedups for a key high-degree sum-check sub-protocol in the Shout batch-evaluation argument.
