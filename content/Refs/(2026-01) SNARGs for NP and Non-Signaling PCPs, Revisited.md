# Abstract

> We revisit the question of whether it is possible to build succinct non-interactive arguments ($\mathsf{SNARG}$s) for all of $\mathsf{NP}$ under standard assumptions using non-signaling probabilistically checkable proofs [Kalai-Raz-Rothblum, STOC' 14]. In particular, we observe that using exponential-length PCPs appears to circumvent all of the existing barriers. 
> 
> For our main result, we give a candidate non-adaptive $\mathsf{SNARG}$ for $\mathsf{NP}$ and prove its soundness under:
> 
> - the learning with errors assumption (or other standard assumptions such as bilinear maps), and
> - a mathematical conjecture about multivariate polynomials over the reals. 
> 
> In more detail, our conjecture is an upper bound on the minimum total coefficient size of Nullstellensatz proofs (Potechin-Zhang, ICALP 2024) of membership in a concrete polynomial ideal. We emphasize that this is not a cryptographic assumption or any form of computational hardness assumption.
> 
> Of particular interest is the fact that our security analysis makes non-black-box use of the $\mathsf{SNARG}$ adversary, circumventing the black-box barrier of Gentry and Wichs (STOC '11). This gives a blueprint for constructing $\mathsf{SNARG}$s for $\mathsf{NP}$ that is not subject to the Gentry-Wichs barrier.
