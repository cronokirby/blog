The first [[Elmore Leonard]] novel I've read. His style is polished, precise, and shows a lot of realism, especially in dialogue. The story here was very entertaining, with many more stages than what you might expect.

The dynamic between the main characters was very compelling, especially as it shifted over the book. It was also very funny, especially the ending.
