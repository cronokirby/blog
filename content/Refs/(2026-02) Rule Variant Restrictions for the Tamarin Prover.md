# Abstract

> We introduce an optimization to the Tamarin prover that reduces its search space. The optimization applies to protocol models that use equational theories with cancellative operators, for example, when modelling Diffie-Hellman groups or bilinear pairings. We prove the optimization's soundness and evaluate its performance.
