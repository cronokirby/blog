# Abstract

> Non-malleable codes allow a sender to transmit a message to a receiver, while providing a ``best-possible'' integrity guarantee to ensure that no attacker---who cannot already decode the message---can meaningfully tamper the message in transit. If tampered, the received message should either be invalid or unrelated to the original message. Non-malleable time-lock puzzles (TLPs) are a special case of non-malleable codes for bounded polynomial-depth tampering with very efficient encoding.
> 
> In this work, we give generic techniques for constructing non-malleable codes and non-malleable TLPs with improved rate, which captures the ratio of a message's length to its encoding length. 
> 
> A key contribution of our work is identifying a security notion for non-malleability, which we term ``CCA-hiding'', sufficient for our compilers. CCA-hiding is a relaxation of CCA-security for encryption or commitments to the fine-grained setting of codes, and requires that the encoded message remains hidden, even given a decoding oracle for any other codeword. Intriguingly, CCA-hiding does not imply non-malleability in the fine-grained setting, as is the case for encryption and commitments. 
> 
> Using our new techniques, we give the following constructions: 
> -- Rate-1 CCA-hiding TLPs in the plain model.
> -- Rate-1 non-malleable codes for bounded polynomial-depth tampering in the auxiliary-input random oracle model (AI-ROM).
> -- Rate-(1/2) non-malleable TLPs in the AI-ROM.
