# Abstract

> We introduce one-time oblivious polynomial signatures (OOPS), a signature scheme based on polynomials over pairing-based elliptic curves that can securely produce signatures for up to a threshold of $n$ different messages. Signing more than $n$ messages allows anyone to forge signatures under the given parameters, making it necessary to reparameterize the scheme occasionally. We show that this property is not a severe limitation though by demonstrating how to build various efficient OOPS-based cryptographic protocols, including delegatable signatures, $1$-out-of-$n$ oblivious transfer, and partially oblivious PRFs.
