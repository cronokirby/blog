# Abstract

> Non-interactive blind signatures (NIBS) capture the minimal setting of blind signatures where the message space is restricted to unstructured random strings. They enable a signer to pre-compute presignatures without prior interaction, while ensuring that only the intended recipient can derive the corresponding blind signature.
> 
> In this work, we consider the problem of threshold issuance of NIBS. Specifically, we introduce the notion of non-interactive threshold blind signatures (NITBS), where a user obtains partial presignatures from a threshold of signers and locally combines them into a valid blind signature. We provide a formal treatment of this primitive by defining the corresponding security notions of blindness and one-more unforgeability. We then present the first concrete construction of NITBS, obtained by adapting the Pointcheval-Sanders (PS) signature scheme, and establish its security in the algebraic group model. Our micro-benchmarking results show that our construction attains the smallest presignature and signature sizes and the fastest issuance among all existing NIBS schemes.
