# Abstract

> Covenants and ZKP verification directly on Bitcoin L1 have long been regarded as infeasible due to the limited expressiveness of Bitcoin Script and the absence of covenant-enabling opcodes such as OP_CAT, OP_CTV, OP_VAULT or OP_CSFS. These limitations have prevented the realization of zkRollups, trustless bridges, and programmable vaults natively on Bitcoin.
> 
> This work introduces Bitcoin PIPEs v2, an upgrade to the original Bitcoin PIPEs approach focusing on emulating missing covenant functionality practically without requiring a soft fork. At its core, a PIPE v2 uses a witness encryption (WE) scheme to lock a Bitcoin private key under an NP statement. The key (and thus the ability to spend the associated coins) can be recovered only by a participant who provides a valid witness (e.g., a SNARK proof) satisfying that statement. Once unlocked, the mechanism outputs a standard Schnorr signature indistinguishable from any other Bitcoin signature. From Bitcoin’s perspective, transactions appear entirely ordinary; yet they are cryptographically guaranteed to enforce arbitrary off-chain logic.
> 
> We formalize how PIPEs v2 enable arbitrary spending conditions on Bitcoin by enforcing predicates on signatures through cryptography, without requiring any consensus changes. We introduce a new primitive, the Witness Signature (WS), which captures conditional signing under hard relations. We show that a PIPE instantiated with a WE scheme and a standard digital signature scheme enables programmable covenants and SNARK-verifiable conditions on Bitcoin—entirely without soft forks, trusted parties, or interactive fraud-proof mechanisms such as those used in BitVM constructions.
> 
> Finally, we explore Arithmetic Affine Determinant Program (AADP)-based witness encryption as a concrete and promising research direction for realizing PIPEs. AADPs provide an explicit arithmetic framework for enforcing SNARK-verifiable NP predicates within the PIPE architecture.
> 
> This work presents a new, second-generation construction of PIPEs (PIPEs v2) for Bitcoin, extending and replacing the earlier formulation proposed in [Kom24].
