# Abstract

> Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zkSNARKs) are  important cryptographic primitives critical in many real-world applications. zkSNARKs are not used in isolation but are deployed within a broader context in which other cryptographic protocols may be concurrently executed.  Universal-Composability (UC) allows rigorous analysis of cryptographic primitives being used in such  arbitrary contexts.  A UC analysis is even more desirable for popular, well-audited, and heavily deployed zkSNARKs already being used in practice.
> Prior works that study the UC security of existing zkSNARKs (without modifications) are either not modular, hence requiring case-by-case analysis for new proof systems, or have largely focused on zkSNARKs in the Random Oracle Model (ROM). The latter includes zkSNARKs with logarithmic proof sizes compiled from Interactive Oracle Proofs.  This state of the art leaves out a large family of very efficient, often  constant-size, zkSNARKs that rely on the Algebraic Group Model (AGM) and optionally on the ROM. This includes zkSNARKs compiled from Polynomial Interactive Oracle Proofs, such as Plonk and Marlin, among others.
> In this work, we address the UC security for unmodified zkSNARKs that are proven secure in AGM (+ROM). Our approach is modular: we identify simple, and mostly standard properties on the underlying zkSNARK that imply UC security. We observe that checking these properties for existing zkSNARKs is a surprisingly  simple task using the rigorous formulation of AGM from Jaeger and Mohan (CRYPTO'24). The simplicity and modularity of our framework makes it easy-to-use for concluding UC security  of several  zkSNARKs  in the same setting. Concretely,  using our framework we establish that Plonk and Marlin are UC secure without any  overhead.
