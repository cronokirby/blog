# Abstract

> Pseudorandom error-correcting codes (PRCs), introduced by Christ and Gunn at CRYPTO’24, combine pseudorandomness with error correction, providing a natural abstraction for robust watermarking and
> steganography on generative AI models. Subsequent standalone notions, which are ideal security for secret-key PRCs and CCA-style security for public-key PRCs, are oracle-based and do not capture composable use with explicit parties, sessions, and corruption.
> 
> We give a UC treatment of PRCs via corruption-aware ideal functionalities for both settings. Under non-adaptive corruption, the UC notions recover the standalone ones. Under adaptive corruption, we identify a common obstruction: dummy codewords sampled before corruption, together with their neighborhoods, must later be opened as valid PRC codewords. We formalize this as a decoder-non-committing code (NC-PRC), which any adaptively UC-secure realization must induce. We then capture failures of such openings via targeted low opening capacity, show it rules out robust NC-PRCs, and prove that LDPC-based PRCs have this property hence do not admit a NC-PRC.
> 
> On the positive side, we sketch two compilers to lift error-correcting
> codes to admit NC-PRCs: a secret-key one from a puncturable PRF
> and indistinguishability obfuscation (iO), and a public-key one from a
> smooth projective hash function (SPHF), both evading the barrier via
> programmable acceptance.
> 
> Finally, we identify a fresh-codeword explanation barrier for public-key
> PRCs: accepted unseen codewords cannot be explained from public information without violating pseudorandomness, so public-key UC realizations require a trapdoor or an idealized setup.
