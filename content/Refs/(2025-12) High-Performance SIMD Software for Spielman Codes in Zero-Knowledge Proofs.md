# Abstract

> We present the first high-performance SIMD software implementation of Spielman codes for their use in polynomial commitment schemes and zero-knowledge proofs. Spielman codes, as used in the Brakedown framework, are attractive alternatives to Reed-Solomon codes and benefit from linear-time complexity and field agnosticism. However, the practical deployment of Spielman codes has been hindered by a lack of research on efficient implementations. The involved costly finite-field arithmetic and random memory accesses operate on large volumes of data, typically exceeding gigabytes; these pose significant challenges for performance gains. To address these challenges, we propose several computational and memory-related optimizations that together reach an order-of-magnitude performance improvement in software. On the computation side, we propose SIMD optimizations using the AVX-512-IFMA instruction set and introduce a lazy reduction method to minimize the modular arithmetic cost. On the memory side, we implement a cache-friendly memory layout and a slicing technique, which exploit the CPU memory hierarchy. Finally, we present our multithreading approach to improve throughput without saturating memory bandwidth. Compared to prior Spielman software, our optimizations achieve speedups of up to 21.9x and 20.6x for single- and multi-threaded execution, respectively. In addition, instantiating our software with 64 threads on a high-end CPU even outperforms a recent FPGA accelerator by up to 4.3x for small and mid-sized polynomials. Our improvements make Spielman codes competitive with well-optimized Reed-Solomon codes on software platforms.
