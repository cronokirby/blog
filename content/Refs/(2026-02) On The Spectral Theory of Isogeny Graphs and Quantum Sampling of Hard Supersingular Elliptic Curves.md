# Abstract

> In this paper we study the problem of sampling random supersingular elliptic curves
> with unknown endomorphism rings. This task has recently attracted significant
> attention, as the secure instantiation of many isogeny-based cryptographic protocols relies on the ability to sample such "hard'' curves. Existing approaches, however, achieve this only in a trusted-setup setting.
> We present the first provable quantum polynomial-time algorithm that samples a random hard supersingular elliptic curve with high probability. Our algorithm runs heuristically in $\tilde{O}\!\left(\log^{4}p\right)$ quantum  gate complexity  and  in  $\tilde{O}\!\left(\log^{13} p\right)$ under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. As a consequence, our algorithm gives a secure instantiation of the CGL hash function and other cryptographic primitives. 
> Our analysis relies on a new spectral delocalization result for supersingular $\ell$-isogeny graphs: we prove the Quantum Unique Ergodicity conjecture, and we further provide numerical evidence for complete eigenvector delocalization; this theoretical result may be of independent interest. Along the way, we prove a stronger $\varepsilon$-separation property for eigenvalues of isogeny graphs than that predicted in the quantum money protocol of Kane, Sharif, and Silverberg, thereby removing a key heuristic assumption in their construction.
