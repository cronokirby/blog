# Abstract

> The classical results of Cramer et al. [Crypto’94] showed how to compose $n$ $\Sigma$-protocols with statistical HVZK to obtain an efficient proof of knowledge of their disjunction maintaining statistical HVZK without adding hardness assumptions. The Fiat-Shamir (FS) transform applied to their construction produces a statistical NIZK proof of knowledge in the random oracle (RO) model, but, unfortunately, the proof size in their case is linear in $n$.
> Recently, there has been increasing interest in solving the major open problem of obtaining statistical NIZK proofs of knowledge for disjunctions starting from $\Sigma$-protocols, with improved communication and minimizing hardness assumptions. The current best results are due 1) to Goel et al. [Eurocrypt '22], which, unfortunately, require Dlog-based assumptions, and 2) to Boudgoust and Simkin [TCC '24] which, unfortunately, obtain computational ZK only.
> In this work, we solve the above open problem showing, for a large class of $\Sigma$-protocols, how to obtain a non-interactive compact statistical NIZK proof of knowledge without adding hardness assumptions, therefore only relying on random oracles.
> More precisely, the communication complexity of our construction is $O(\lambda^2\log{n})+\mathsf{CC}(\Sigma)$ where $\lambda$ is the security parameter and $\mathsf{CC}(\Sigma)$ is the communication of a single run of the underlying $\Sigma$-protocol, and this is obtained via calls to a random oracle and to a prover executing a stand-alone instance of the $\Sigma$-protocol.
