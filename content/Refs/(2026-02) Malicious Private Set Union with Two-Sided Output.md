# Abstract

> Private Set Union (PSU) allows two parties to compute the union of their private sets without revealing any additional information---in particular, it hides their common elements (the intersection).
> Although recent years have seen significant progress under the semi-honest model, resulting in several efficient two-party PSU protocols, notable gaps remain: (1) some prior works model the semi-honest PSU functionality inaccurately, and (2) practical and scalable maliciously secure protocols are still lacking, except when relying on heavy generic techniques (e.g., FHE, GMW, or general purpose NIZK).
> 
> In this paper, we address these issues directly and summarize our contributions as follows:
>   1. We revisit the formal definition of PSU, covering both the standard one-sided functionality (where only one party receives the output) and the two-sided variant (where both parties receive the output), refuting several flawed claims from prior work, and show that the notion of ``during-execution leakage'' was not well-defined in the literature, since the ``enhanced'' functionality is actually equivalent to the standard one.
>   2. We show how one of the fastest semi-honest protocols can be strengthened against malicious senders with a simple ad-hoc modification, while preserving its efficiency and simplicity.
>   3. As our main result, we present the first practical, concretely efficient, and maliciously secure two-sided PSU protocol, achieving at least a quadratic improvement over prior work. Along the way, we also resolve the challenge of assuring honest behavior for the hash-to-curve function in the PSU context---a task generally regarded as impractical due to the non-algebraic nature of the hash function.
>   4. We implement both protocols and compare them with existing schemes. Our experiments demonstrate that our maliciously secure protocols are only ${1.1\!-\!2.4}\times$ slower than the most efficient semi-honest protocols in the literature.
