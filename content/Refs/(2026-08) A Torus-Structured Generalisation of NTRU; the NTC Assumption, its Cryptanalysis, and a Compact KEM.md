# Abstract

> We introduce Noisy Torus Conjugation (NTC), a lattice assumption in which a short secret is confined to a non-split maximal torus of $GL_k(R_q)$ and acts by conjugation on a uniform matrix, the result being masked by a short additive error. NTRU is the $k=1$ member of the family. Passing to $k \ge 2$ changes the geometry of the underlying lattice in two specific ways. The planted module occupies a fraction $1/(2k)$ of the published lattice's dimension, against NTRU's $1/2$; and the norm-map shortcut that governs the overstretched regime is blocked once the conjugated matrix is required to be uniform over the full matrix algebra instead of the torus.
> We develop the structure theory of the assumption: marginal uniformity of each component, invariance along the torus orbit, a rigidity theorem identifying the full set of short solutions, and a reduction from search to decision. On it we build an IND-CCA key encapsulation mechanism whose passive security reduces tightly to NTC together with one isolated decisional assumption. At NIST categories 1, 3 and 5 it reaches public keys within 1.08 to 1.16 times Kyber's and ciphertexts 2.0 to 2.1 times Kyber's.
> The new assumption is not load-bearing but purchasable. Widening the key distribution to the smoothing parameter of the key lattice would make the public key statistically uniform and remove it altogether, leaving IND-CPA on module-LWE and hence on a worst-case problem. We price that variant at a factor 3.4 on the public key and 4.0 on the ciphertext. It rests, however, on a regularity statement not established for the completely split rings our transform uses; we isolate that statement as a conjecture and give a modulus class for which it is not needed.
> Concrete parameters are selected with an estimator calibrated against the published core-SVP figures of Kyber, and validated against a hybrid
> meet-in-the-middle model whose single free constant is fitted on Kyber. The fatigue predictions underlying the modulus window are tested further by lattice reduction. We reduce small instances of the published lattice against NTRU controls of identical dimension, determinant and planted-vector norm, and at every modulus the NTRU plant is discovered as a dense sublattice while the sparser NTC plant is not. A companion paper builds a Fiat-Shamir-with-aborts signature from the same assumption. The assumption is new and has no worst-case reduction; we state throughout what is proved, what is heuristic, what is measured, and what remains open.
