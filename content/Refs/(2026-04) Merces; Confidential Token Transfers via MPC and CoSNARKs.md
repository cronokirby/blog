# Abstract

> Fungible tokens on public blockchains expose all balances and transfer amounts in the clear, which is incompatible with the financial privacy required by many real-world applications. We present Merces a confidential token contract that hides user balances and transaction amounts while preserving on-chain verifiability. The core idea is to store secret shares of balances within a decentralized MPC network, while only commitments are published to a smart contract. Thereby, Merces is capable of translating any existing token (e.g., any ERC20 token) into a confidential version. Deposits, withdrawals, and transfers are computed privately within the MPC network, which generates a collaborative SNARK (CoSNARK) to prove the validity of each state transition. In particular, the proof ensures that on-chain commitments are updated consistently and that the sender has sufficient funds. In this paper we give a full formalization of our construction in the Universal Composability (UC) framework, provide rigorous security proofs, and describe a concrete instantiation using Groth16 over BN254 with Poseidon2-based commitments. We further provide a complete end-to-end implementation, accompanied by extensive benchmarks and discussion of a working demo: our system achieves over 300 transactions per second, including proof generation, while requiring only minimal client-side computation.
