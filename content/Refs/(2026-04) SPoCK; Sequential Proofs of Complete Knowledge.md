# Abstract

> A proof of knowledge certifies that the prover “knows” a secret. This property is established by the existence of an extractor that, given access to the prover, can extract the secret. Unfortunately, this does not  imply that a single entity has access to the secret in the clear, as it may be secret-shared among several parties and the proof computed using multiparty computation (MPC), or the secret may be embedded in a trusted execution environment (TEE) that only allows limited access to it.
> 
> Often, the ability to encumber a secret in this way breaks the security of a system; vote selling in e-voting schemes is one example. To address this, two recent papers introduced the notions of “Proofs of Complete Knowledge” (PoCK) [Kelkar et al., CCS’24] and “Individual Cryptography” [Dziembowski et al., CRYPTO’23]. While the goals and constructions in those works differ, both rely on the same key idea to prevent encumbrance. To compute a proof, the prover must evaluate a hash function on a huge number of inputs. One then assumes that only a fraction of those can be encumbered, while for the rest the prover must know the inputs in the clear, and these clear inputs are sufficient to extract the secret. Computing a huge number of hashes is a challenge even for an honest prover (who has the secret in the clear), so those works suggest using outdated Bitcoin mining hardware to make the scheme practical.
> 
> By forcing the prover to evaluate the hashes in a sequential manner, we could get meaningful security against encumbrance with far fewer hashes, especially against MPC, where round complexity is a major bottleneck.
> 
> As a concrete instantiation of this idea, we define and construct Sequential Proofs of Complete Knowledge (SPoCK). Our construction uses the PoCK of Kelkar et al. (which are based on Fischlin’s straight-line extractable proofs of knowledge). The computation of this PoCK is then embedded into the computation of the Proof of Sequential Work from [Cohen&Pietrzak, EUROCRYPT’18]. SPoCK thus have the potential to enable complete-knowledge or individual-cryptography primitives where honest parties can use standard hardware. We also propose a variant of this scheme that requires a large amount of memory throughout the evaluation, providing better security also against TEEs.
