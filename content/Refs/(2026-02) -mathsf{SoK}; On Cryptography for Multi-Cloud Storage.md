# Abstract

> This paper is a Systematization of Knowledge ($\mathsf{SoK}$) on cryptography applied in Multi-Cloud Storage ($\mathsf{MCS}$) schemes. 
> Such techniques distribute and fragment data among multiple cloud providers to strengthen confidentiality, integrity, and availability compared to single-cloud deployments. 
> Over the past decade, many cryptographic mechanisms have been proposed to secure outsourced data. However, the lack of unified framework has led to fragmented terminology, inconsistent trust assumptions, and unclear comparisons between existing protocols.
> In this $\mathsf{SoK}$, we analyze and classify existing $\mathsf{MCS}$ approaches along two complementary dimensions: (i) their architectural trust models, and (ii) the cryptographic primitives they employ to achieve confidentiality, integrity, availability, access control, and auditability.
> This taxonomy allows us to highlight recurring design patterns, evaluate trade-offs between security and efficiency, and identify redundancies and research gaps. 
> By unifying terminology and mapping the landscape of cryptographic techniques in $\mathsf{MCS}$, this $\mathsf{SoK}$ provides both researchers and practitioners a structured foundation to guide future designs and deployments.
