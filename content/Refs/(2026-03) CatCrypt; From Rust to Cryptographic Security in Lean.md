# Abstract

> We describe the methodology and scope of CatCrypt, a library for machine-checked cryptographic security proofs in Lean. CatCrypt provides an end-to-end pipeline from Rust reference implementations to security proofs in the computational model in Lean.
> The translation from Rust to Lean is done using the Hax tool.
> 
> CatCrypt covers 172 cryptographic protocols and constructions with machine-checked security theorems in the computational model.
> Of these, 110 have the full Rust-to-Lean pipeline.  All bounds have been systematically cross-referenced against their published sources (IETF RFCs, NIST standards, and academic papers). Some proofs were ported from SSProve (Rocq), EasyCrypt, ProVerif, CryptoVerif and Squirrel; most are independent formalisations with no prior machine-checked treatment. CatCrypt also includes a verified Lean implementation of a substantial part of the hax transpiler pipeline.
> 
> This work is an experiment of what can be done by a researcher working with GenAI. Until recently, the formalization of one protocol required months of expert effort. In contrast, the whole of CatCrypt was developed in a period of two months. Because it was developed with AI, we develop a new methodology to increase confidence that the specifications are correct. Moreover, we will continue to audit the code in the coming months to gain even more confidence in the specification of the results.
> 
> We hope this work will facilitate the adoption of formal methods in the development of security-critical software. This is especially urgent due to AI's increased hacking capabilities, the explosion of AI generated software and the ongoing post-quantum transition, which requires the development of new cryptographic protocols and their secure implementation.
