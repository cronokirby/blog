# Abstract

> We construct compilers that convert any secure signature scheme into a single-round blind signature scheme. An important property of the construction is that the final blind signature has exactly the same format as the underlying signature scheme, making the blind signature scheme backwards compatible with the underlying scheme. Our compilers make use of (two-key) fully homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proofs to ensure unforgeability and blindness of the final scheme. We present three compilers where the main differences is which party does the bulk of the work: the client, the signer, or both. Along the way we introduce a new notion of verifiable FHE that we call committed verifiable FHE, where the verifier does not see the circuit in the clear.
