# Abstract

> In this paper we present a Schnorr-like linkable ring signature scheme we call d/v-CLSAG that is extension for d-CLSAG scheme. The proposed extension allows the use of different group generators for different layers of the ring members, while the original scheme assumes the use of the same generator G across all layers. We provide the security statements for the proposed updated scheme.
