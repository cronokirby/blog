# Abstract

> An asymmetric Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (aPAKE) protocol allows a client, who holds a raw password, and a server, who holds a one-way mapping of the password, to jointly establish a cryptographically strong session key, without an authenticated channel. The standard security definition for aPAKE is in the Universal Composability (UC) framework. Despite its great potential of being used in practice, existing aPAKE protocols are either not round-optimal, computationally inefficient, or not proven secure.
> 
> In this work, we present two aPAKE protocols that are 1 simultaneous round, UC-secure, have reasonable computational costs, and rely on mild cryptographic assumptions. Our first protocol is in the Random Oracle Model and the Algebraic Group Model (ROM+AGM), secure under the CDH assumption, and has computational cost comparable to the most efficient aPAKE protocols in the literature (1 simultaneous round or not). Our second protocol is in the ROM only and secure under the DDH assumption, and also has significantly lower computational cost than the only other UC-secure 1 simultaneous round aPAKE protocol. Interestingly, even our second protocol does not rely on the gap Diffie-Hellman assumption, which requires creative application of the forking lemma.
