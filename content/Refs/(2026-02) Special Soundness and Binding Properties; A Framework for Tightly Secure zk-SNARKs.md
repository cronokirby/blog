# Abstract

> Interactive arguments often combine polynomial IOPs with polynomials commitment schemes (PCSs).
>      Frequently, the interactive argument is proven to be knowledge sound, but this incurs a high security loss when applying the Fiat-Shamir transformation to obtain a non-interactive argument in the random oracle model (ROM).
> 
>      We introduce the notion of special soundness for polynomial IOPs, which surprisingly has not been considered before.
>      We study relations between various binding properties of univariate PCSs. In the case of the KZG PCS, these properties can be based on falsifiable assumptions.
>      We prove that a special-sound polynomial IOP plus a PCS under suitable binding notions gives a computationally special-sound interactive argument. By Attema, Fehr, and Klooss (TCC 2022), applying Fiat-Shamir to this argument yields a tightly knowledge-sound argument (or zk-SNARK) in the ROM under the same assumptions.
>      In the case of the KZG PCS, we add various batching optimizations to our compiler and prove that they preserve computational special soundness.
>     This yields a generic approach for achieving efficient zk-SNARKs with constant proof size and tight knowledge soundness in the ROM under falsifiable assumptions.
