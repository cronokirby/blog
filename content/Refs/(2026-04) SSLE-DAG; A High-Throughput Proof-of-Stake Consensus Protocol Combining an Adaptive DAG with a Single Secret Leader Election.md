# Abstract

> SSLE-DAG Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains with publicly visible leader schedules expose future proposers to targeted Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Single Secret Leader Election (SSLE) techniques address this problem by hiding the leader's identity until block publication. However, existing SSLE techniques are difficult to integrate with high-throughput Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based Proof-of-Stake consensus protocols. We introduce SSLE-DAG, a PoS consensus protocol that combines a zk-SNARK-based SSLE commitment scheme with the adaptive DAG-based consensus protocol that splits or merges parallel chains (and thus regulates throughput) upon transaction demand. The commitment scheme uses EdDSA signatures, MiMC hashing, and Merkle proofs to guarantee uniqueness, fairness, and unpredictability while keeping leader identities private. We implement SSLE-DAG in Go (gnark) and evaluate it in a geo-distributed simulation using real-world latency traces. In a 60-node network, we achieve about 990 TPS, and in a 40-node network with shorter rounds, we reach about 1,600 TPS with low variance in block rewards.
