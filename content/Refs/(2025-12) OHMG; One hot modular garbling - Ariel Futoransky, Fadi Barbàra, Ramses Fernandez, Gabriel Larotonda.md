# Abstract

> We propose a novel mechanism for garbling wires and gates of a logical circuit in a privacy-free environment, focusing on the authenticity of the protocol. It is based on one-hot encodings, tensor products and elliptic curve arithmetic. This scheme is designed to work with arithmetic gates, but we also show gadgets to implement transitions from binary inputs to arithmetic outputs and vice versa. For our scheme, each arithmetic gate takes at most one cyphertext of material to execute its functionality (assuming knowledge of the garbled inputs and their cleartexts). We show an application to blockchain transactions. The security of the scheme is proved in the UC setting.
