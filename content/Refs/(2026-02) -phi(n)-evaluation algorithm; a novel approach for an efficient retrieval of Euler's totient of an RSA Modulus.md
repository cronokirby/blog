# Abstract

> In this paper, we propose an algorithm to efficiently retrieve the value of Euler's totient function of an RSA modulus, consequently voiding the RSA encryption. Furthermore, we show that the proposed algorithm is significantly faster and more effective when the prime factors of an RSA modulus are closer to each other. We conjecture a relation between the difference of two prime factors of the RSA modulus and the required number of steps for the algorithm.
