# Abstract

> A data availability sampling scheme (DAS) allows a network of verifiers to collectively ensure that an untrusted party is correctly storing and distributing some committed data. Importantly, the protocol should not require that the verifiers coordinate or store the full data individually.
> 
> In this paper, we initiate the study of privacy in DAS schemes: we ask whether the DAS guarantees can be upheld while keeping the committed data secret. We define a natural notion of zero-knowledge for DAS and show that no secure DAS scheme can satisfy this notion. In doing so, we motivate the need to study privacy-preserving variants of DAS.
> 
> We define eDAS as DAS schemes over encrypted data and introduce the necessary security notions; namely, completeness, soundness and consistency. We additionally define a notion of privacy (zero-knowledge) and compliance (policy-enforcing). We then present two constructions of eDAS schemes. The first uses a DAS scheme as a black box and can be deployed on top of existing production-ready DAS systems with only minor modifications. The second is a more efficient construction that relies on the same principles but removes various layers of abstraction.
