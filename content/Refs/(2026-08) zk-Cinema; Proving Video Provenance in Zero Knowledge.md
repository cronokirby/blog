# Abstract

> Video provenance is an important problem on the modern internet.
> In response, the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity
> (C2PA) has developed a standard for verifying video and image
> provenance where cameras sign captured videos with an on-device
> secret key. Since videos are generally edited and resized before be-
> ing posted, the C2PA signature from a camera cannot be used as is
> to verify provenance of published videos. Prior work has developed
> zero-knowledge techniques for verifying provenance of edited im-
> ages and videos. In this work, we develop new efficient techniques
> for producing such zero-knowledge proofs. First, we show how to
> represent common video edits as matrix multiplications in a form
> that is particularly friendly for zero-knowledge provers and enables
> a number of optimizations. Second, we develop a SNARK-friendly
> video representation, which we call sfvr, that reduces prover work
> for video editing. Third, we design new efficient methods for incor-
> porating signed data into a SNARK proof. To evaluate our designs,
> we built an end-to-end system for proving edits to a signed video.
> In our end-to-end system, we optimize the NeutronNova folding
> scheme for high-arity folding. To scale the size of our Neutron-
> Nova proofs, we implement a “Read-Write Streaming” version of
> NeutronNova to take advantage of high-performance storage and
> parallel computing resources. Our system achieves competitive
> performance and scale relative to prior work.
