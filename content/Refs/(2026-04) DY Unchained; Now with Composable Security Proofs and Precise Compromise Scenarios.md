# Abstract

> Cryptographic protocols are the cornerstone of Internet security, and any flaw in their design would have drastic effects. We can formally prove the absence of such flaws using a variety of automated or semi-automated tools. However, some features of real-world protocols are notoriously hard to analyze using these tools, including unbounded loops, unbounded data structures, and unbounded and dynamic number of protocol participants. The DY* protocol verification framework recently emerged as a tool designed to address these challenges, and it was successfully used to analyze protocols such as Signal, ACME and TreeSync.
> 
> However, we note that DY* suffers from two deep limitations: first, security proofs of protocol subcomponents cannot be composed, which hinders the analysis of large protocols; second, the security proofs depend on a simple language to describe compromises, which overly restricts the set of compromise scenarios DY* can reason about.
> 
> In this paper, we present a major overhaul of DY* that addresses these limitations. We enable composing security proofs in DY* by developing a framework to define trace invariants modularly, and we improve the precision of compromise scenarios that DY* can prove by fully generalizing the notion of security labels. These improvements are essential to enable the analysis of large protocols. In particular, our new version of DY* was already used by and crucial to the security proofs of the TreeKEM protocol (IEEE S&P 2025).
