# Abstract

> In a (non-interactive) multi-signature scheme, parties independently generate keys and produce signatures on a common message, which can be aggregated into a single signature verifiable with respect to the set of public keys. Existing multi-signature constructions, however, suffer from at least one of two limitations: either (1) aggregate signatures cannot be further aggregated, or (2) verification requires auxiliary information beyond the set of public keys, such as the aggregation topology.
> 
> We argue that these limitations significantly restrict the applicability of multi-signatures in large-scale distributed systems, such as proof-of-stake blockchains. To address this gap, we initiate the formal study of hint-free multi-signatures, which support multi-hop aggregation while allowing verification using only the set of public keys.
> 
> To the best of our knowledge, the only previously known (folklore) construction that is fully hint-free relies on recursive SNARKs, which introduces unclear heuristics for security (e.g., proving statements about random oracle relations) or inherently limits the depth of the aggregation topology.
> 
> We show that hint-free multi-signatures can be realized without proof recursion, in the standard model. At a high level, we show how to publicly normalize BLS multi-signatures so that verification depends only on the set of public keys rather than a multi-set. While our scheme is not practical (it uses indistinguishability obfuscation), it establishes the feasibility of the primitive provides a foundation for future work on practical constructions.
