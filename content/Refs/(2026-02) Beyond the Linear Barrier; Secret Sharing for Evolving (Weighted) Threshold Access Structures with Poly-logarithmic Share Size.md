# Abstract

> Evolving secret sharing allows a dealer to share a secret message between a growing number of $n$ parties. Crucially, the dealer does not know an upper bound on $n$, neither it knows the access structure before party $n$ arrives; furthermore, the dealer is not allowed to update the shares of old parties.
> We construct new secret sharing schemes for so-called evolving (weighted) threshold access, in which the arrival of party $n$ determines the number of parties $t_n \le n$ that are required in order to reconstruct the secret. We also consider the more general case in which party $n$ has associated a weight $w_n$ with logarithmic size, and the authorized subsets of parties are those for which the sum of the corresponding weights exceeds the current threshold $t_n$. In particular, we obtain:
> - A secret sharing scheme for evolving threshold access structures with adaptive privacy in the plain model, and with share size $\mathsf{poly}(\lambda,\log n)$. This construction requires one-way functions (OWFs) and indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) for Turing machines.    
> - A secret sharing scheme for evolving weighted threshold access structures with adaptive privacy in the plain model, and with share size $\mathsf{poly}(\lambda,\log W_n)$ where $W_n$ is the sum of the weights up to party $n$. This construction requires OWFs and iO for Turing machines, and additionally assumes that the weights are fixed (i.e., cannot change over time).
> - A secret sharing scheme for evolving weighted threshold access structures with static privacy in the plain model, and with share size $\mathsf{poly}(\lambda,\log W_n)$. This construction allows the weight of old parties to change over time, but it requires somewhere statistically binding hash functions and achieves only static privacy.
> Previous constructions of secret sharing schemes for evolving (weighted) threshold access structures achieved (much worse) share sizes linear in $W_n$ (and in the security parameter) and, when considering adaptive privacy, they require the random oracle model.
