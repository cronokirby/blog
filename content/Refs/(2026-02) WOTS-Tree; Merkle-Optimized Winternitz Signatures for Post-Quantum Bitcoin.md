# Abstract

> We present WOTS-Tree, a stateful hash-based signature scheme for Bitcoin that combines WOTS+ one-time signatures with a binary Merkle tree, supporting up to $2^{21}$ independent signatures per address. The construction instantiates XMSS with parameters specifically optimized for Bitcoin's UTXO model, using a dual hash function design: SHA-256 truncated to 128 bits ($n=16$, $w=256$) for WOTS+ chain evaluations, and full 256-bit SHA-256 for Merkle tree compression. Deployed as dual leaves within BIP-341 Taproot (compatible with the proposed BIP-360 Pay-to-Merkle-Root), the default (hardened) mode provides: (i) a fast-path for single-use UTXOs at 353 bytes, and (ii) a fallback tree for Replace-By-Fee and address reuse at 675 bytes ($K=1{,}024$). For Lightning channels, $K=2^{21}$ yields 1,028-byte witnesses with a 19-second one-time setup. An opt-in compact mode using truncated 128-bit Merkle nodes reduces witnesses to 515--692 bytes at the cost of reduced Merkle binding security ($\approx 60$ bits). WOTS-Tree achieves strict L1 verification bounds of 4,601 hashes ($\approx 0.009$ ms on SHA-NI hardware). The default parameterization provides 115.8-bit classical and 57.9-bit quantum forgery resistance, with the Merkle binding at $\approx 124$ bits, exceeding the WOTS+ forgery bound in both classical and quantum settings. We provide a complete security reduction with concrete bounds, a dual hash instantiation analysis, and a reference implementation with comprehensive test coverage. Default-mode witnesses are $4$--$7\times$ smaller than hypertree variants while aligning naturally with Bitcoin's spend-once transaction model.
