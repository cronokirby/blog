I didn't like this one quite as much as [[(1976) Swag|Swag]], but it was still very good. This one follows a man who gets caught having an affair, and blackmailed for it. Rather than comply, he opts to try and take matters into his own hands.

The plot in this one is pretty straightforward, besides some shifting in gears towards the end. Less remarkable than other [[Elmore Leonard|Leonard]] novels, but still very readable, and a cut above crime pulp.
