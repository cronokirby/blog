# Abstract

> Ordered multi-signatures allow multiple signers to sign a common message sequentially, and anyone to verify the signing order of signers with a public-key list. Recently, Baum et al. (PKC 2025) proposed an ordered multi-signature scheme over a pairing-free group by modifying the multi-signature scheme MuSig2 by Nick et al. (CRYPTO 2021). The security of their ordered multi-signature scheme was proven under the algebraic one-more discrete logarithm (AOMDL) assumption in the random oracle model (ROM). The AOMDL assumption is stronger than the discrete logarithm (DL) assumption. To strengthen the assurance of security, it is desirable either to prove their scheme under the DL assumption or give a construction whose security is proven under the DL assumption.
> In this paper, we give an ordered multi-signature scheme from linear hash function families. Our scheme is obtained by generalizing Baum et al.’s scheme via linear hash function families. The security of our scheme is proven under the algebraic one-more preimage resistance (AOMPR) property of a linear hash function in the ROM. There is a linear hash function whose AOMPR property can be proven under the DL assumption. Thus, by using this linear hash function, we obtain the first DL- based ordered multi-signature scheme.
