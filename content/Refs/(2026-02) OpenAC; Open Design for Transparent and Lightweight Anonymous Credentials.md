# Abstract

> Digital identity systems require mechanisms for verifiable, privacy-preserving presentations of user attestations. The trivial approach of utilizing selective disclosure by presenting individually signed attestations introduces persistent linkability that compromises user anonymity. Existing anonymous credential systems  come with practical drawbacks. Some depend on trusted setups, others require substantial modifications to an issuer’s established issuance flow.
> 
> We propose an open, transparent, and lightweight anonymous credential design that addresses these limitations with the use of zero-knowledge proofs. Our construction is modular, requires no trusted setup and integrates with existing workflows without the need for substantial changes to existing cryptographic mechanisms, procedure overhauls, or hardware devices. It delivers unlinkability while maintaining broad applicability across heterogeneous digital-identity ecosystems and current verifiable credential standards.
> 
> To demonstrate practicality, we provide a proof-of-concept implementation and benchmarks on mobile devices. Our results show best-in-class proving times, with a focus on efficient client-side proving, an essential requirement for usability in digital identity wallets.
> 
> OpenAC was purposely constructed to be compatible with the European Digital Identity Architecture and Reference Framework (EUDI ARF). In the appendix, we map EUDI ARF’s functional, privacy, and interoperability requirements, illustrating how OpenAC satisfies regulatory constraints while preserving strong user privacy.
