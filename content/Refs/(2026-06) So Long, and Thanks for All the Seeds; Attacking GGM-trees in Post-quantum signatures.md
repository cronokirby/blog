# Abstract

> Post-quantum signatures built from Fiat--Shamir transforms of zero-knowledge 
> identification protocols---including LESS, CROSS, and MEDS---use GGM-tree seed 
> compression to shrink signatures, revealing only the seeds of public rounds 
> while hiding the challenge-dependent ones. This mechanism introduces a 
> fault-attack surface: faulting the seed-publication can expose hidden seeds 
> alongside their zero-knowledge responses, enabling recovery of secret 
> information. We introduce the Generic ZK Seed Tree (GZKST), a unified 
> abstraction of GGM-tree generation, challenge partitioning, and seed 
> publication across these schemes, and formalize its correctness and 
> seed-hiding invariants. We show that prior attacks on LESS-v1 and LESS-v2 
> violate the same invariant despite targeting different implementation layers 
> and tree constructions, derive generic key-recovery algorithms from this view, 
> and bound the number of effective faulted signatures needed for full 
> recovery---only a few successful queries suffice for every MEDS parameter set. 
> We further demonstrate the attacks in practice through clock-glitch fault 
> injection against the MEDS reference implementation on an ARM Cortex-M4 
> (ChipWhisperer-Lite), identifying multiple exploitable surfaces in tree 
> traversal and path construction that enable complete tree disclosure, partial 
> subtree recovery, or leakage of hidden leaves.
