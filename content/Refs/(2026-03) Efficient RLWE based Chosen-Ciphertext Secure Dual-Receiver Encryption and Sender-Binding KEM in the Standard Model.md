# Abstract

> Key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) is an often used primitive in communication, closely related to public key encryption (PKE). Dual-receiver encryption (DRE) is another primitive closely related to PKE that allows a sender to encrypt a message to two different receivers. Most applications of DRE need the soundness property which  guarantees that both receivers decrypt any ciphertext to the same message. Addition ally, IND-CPA security is often not enough and therefore schemes should satisfy a stronger notion like IND-CCA2. Meanwhile, an alternative to IND-CCA2 for KEMs is the IND-SB-CPA security notion which was proven to be strong enough to realize secure channels while in theory enabling the construction of more efficient schemes.
> Most IND-CCA2 security proofs rely on the FO transformation, which is only secure in the ROM, and the standard model DREs and KEMs are far from efficient. We fill this gap by providing a sound DRE and a KEM satisfying IND-CCA2 and IND-SB-CPA security respectively. Both schemes are based on RLWE, proven secure in the standard model, and have key sizes of 150 KB and ciphertext sizes of 100 KB, improving upon previous results by a factor of 10x to 100x.
