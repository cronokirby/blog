# Abstract

> Post-quantum signature schemes are becoming increasingly important due to the threat of quantum computers to classical cryptographic schemes. Among the approaches considered in the literature, the MPC-in-the-head paradigm introduced by Ishai et al. (STOC'07) provides an innovative solution for constructing zero-knowledge proofs by exploiting Multi-Party Computation (MPC). This technique has proven to be a versatile tool in order to design efficient cryptographic schemes, including post-quantum signatures. 
> Building on the MPC-in-the-head paradigm, we introduce Bittersweet signatures, a new class of signature schemes based on the Learning With Rounding (LWR) assumption. Their main advantage is conceptual simplicity: by exploiting (almost) key-homomorphic pseudorandom functions (PRFs), a cryptographic object that preserves pseudorandomness while allowing linear operations on keys, we obtain a very regular design offering nice opportunities for parallel implementations. 
> Theoretically, analyzing Bittersweet signatures requires addressing significant challenges related to the (carry) leakage that almost key-homomorphic operations lead to.
> Concretely, Bittersweet signatures natively lead to competitive signature sizes, trading moderate software performance overheads for hardware performance gains when compared to state-of-the-art MPC-in-the-head schemes (e.g., relying on code-based assumptions), while admittedly lagging a bit behind recent algorithms based on
> the VOLE-in-the-head or Threshold-Computation-in-the-head frameworks.
> Besides, their scalability and algebraic structure makes them promising candidates for leakage-resilient implementations. The new abstractions we introduce additionally suggest interesting research directions towards further optimization and generalization.
