# Abstract

> Succinct arguments based on interactive oracle proofs (IOPs) have achieved remarkable efficiency improvements and are now widely adopted in applications. State-of-the-art IOPs involve protocols for testing proximity to constrained interleaved linear codes, and enjoy essentially optimal parameters. However, recent IOP constructions provide no privacy guarantees, which remain a must for many applications.
> 
> We present an IOP of proximity for testing constrained interleaved linear codes that achieves (honest-verifier) zero-knowledge, while incurring a negligible overhead compared to the (non-zero-knowledge) state of the art. In line with recent constructions, our construction satisfies round-by-round knowledge soundness with a straightline extractor and negligible error.
> 
> We propose a definition of (honest-verifier) zero-knowledge for interactive oracle reductions (IORs) that we prove is compatible with composition, and then obtain our result by constructing and modularly composing several lightweight zero-knowledge IORs. Our key technical contributions are a zero-knowledge sumcheck IOR and a zero-knowledge code-switching IOR that fit the strict efficiency requirements of our setting; these contributions and other technical complications entailed overcoming several challenges with new notions and protocols. Finally, along the way, we highlight the efficiency benefits of high-distance codes obtained from dispersers, which may be of independent interest.
