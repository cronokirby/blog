# Abstract

> Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs) provide publicly verifiable pseudorandomness uniquely determined by a secret key and an input. While widely used in decentralized protocols, standard VRF verification reveals the signer's identity, exposing them to targeted adversarial disruption once their eligibility is known.
> 
> We study Ring VRFs(RVRFs), which allow a member of a public key set (a ring) to publish a VRF value along with a proof of correct generation while hiding the signer's index within the set. We formalize an algorithmic RVRF interface that binds the ring into the evaluated input to prevent cross-ring reuse and ring grinding (i.e., the malicious selection of a specific ring configuration to manipulate the pseudorandom outcome). Diverging from existing UC-based treatments, we propose a comprehensive suite of game-based security notions tailored to verifiable randomness under anonymity: correctness, anonymity, pseudorandomness, and a novel corruption-aware uniqueness notion called $T$-uniqueness. Our main technical result is a modular compiler that transforms any provable VRF into an RVRF by proving a one-out-of-many statement for the induced ring relation. We instantiate the OR layer via an optimized Fiat--Shamir OR (FS-OR) composition in the random oracle model, where the prover utilizes prover-side simulation for all non-witness branches and completes the witness branch only after a global consistency constraint is fixed. Focusing on post-quantum resilience, we provide concrete instantiations of our RVRF framework based on two state-of-the-art lattice VRFs: the long-term lattice VRF $\mathsf{LaV}$ by Esgin et al. (Crypto'23) and the few-time lattice VRF $\mathsf{LB}\text{-}\mathsf{VRF}$ by Esgin et al. (FC'19). We provide a detailed analysis of concrete parameters across various ring sizes for both constructions and perform a comprehensive side-by-side comparison of their communication costs and security trade-offs. Our instantiations are modular, with their security reducing cleanly to (i) the base VRF's correctness, pseudorandomness, and per-key uniqueness, and (ii) standard FS-OR properties (simulatability and extractability).
