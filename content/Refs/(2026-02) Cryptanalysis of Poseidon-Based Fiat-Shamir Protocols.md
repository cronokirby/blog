# Abstract

> Poseidon[GKR+19 ] and its successor Poseidon2[GKS23] are arithmetization-oriented
> permutations proposed for hashing inside algebraic proof systems. While there is extensive
> prior work on cryptanalysis of reduced-round Poseidon/Poseidon2 and theoretical and
> practical weaknesses of the Fiat-Shamir transform, these two attacks are typically studied
> in isolation. This work asks whether combining them i.e., instantiating Fiat-Shamir with
> Poseidon can enable new attacks.
> We design and implement multiple candidate attacks that encode verifier checks together
> with reduced-round Poseidon-based challenge derivation as explicit polynomial systems,
> targeting settings such as Sigma protocols and FRI-like degree enforcement. We evaluate
> these approaches using Gr¨obner bases. We use this model to derive Gr¨obner-basis attack
> formulations aimed at constructing verifier-accepting transcripts that violate the intended
> low-degree bound, and we report the computational bottlenecks encountered in representative
> parameter regimes.
> We also document additional explored directions, including retry-style challenge biasing
> and reduced-round investigations, in order to clarify which attacks appear more or less
> promising. Across our implementations, we do not obtain meaningful forgeries: even with
> heavily reduced Poseidon parameters, Gr¨obner-basis computations do not find solutions for
> random instances of the constructed systems. Our results provide negative evidence for
> several natural algebraic attack routes on Poseidon-based Fiat-Shamir instantiations, and
> help clarify which known Fiat-Shamir weaknesses do and do not transfer to well-structured,
> fully transcript-bound deployments.
