# Abstract

> In this work, we introduce the concept of Obliviously Checkable
> Secret-Carrying Puzzles (OxSP) and build proof-friendly Garbled Circuits
> (GCs) to enable their practical implementation. OxSPs allow one to publicly pose
> puzzles and verify purported solutions received in response, keeping
> the desired parts of the puzzles and the responses hidden. 
> 
> We show how OxSPs can be based on Garbled Circuits (GCs). However, this
> requires ZK-SNARK proofs of correctness of garbling. We note that combining
> existing GC and ZK-SNARK constructions results in very large computational
> costs for the OxSP solvers. Our main technical contribution is to design a
> new proof-friendly GC construction which cuts down the cost of generating a
> proof of correct garbling to almost a third, without resorting to
> non-standard cryptographic assumptions.
> 
> Beyond its use in OxSP, we expect our proof-friendly GCs to be of significant
> independent interest, as a tool for auditable secure 2-party computation.
