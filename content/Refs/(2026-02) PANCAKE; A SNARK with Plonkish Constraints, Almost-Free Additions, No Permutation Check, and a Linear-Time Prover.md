# Abstract

> This paper presents \(\mathsf{Pancake}\), a linear-time SNARK with a circuit-specific setup that eliminates the explicit representation and separate verification of addition gates in Plonkish constraint systems. Specifically, we consolidate wiring constraints and addition-gate constraints into a single family of general linear constraints, which can be enforced efficiently via a single sumcheck protocol. As a result, \(\mathsf{Pancake}\) achieves ``almost-free'' addition gates, which significantly reduces the witness size and directly improves prover efficiency while preserving full support for high-degree custom gates.
> 
> Our implementation shows that \(\mathsf{Pancake}\) outperforms the state-of-the-art Plonkish SNARK \(\mathsf{HyperPlonk}\) (Chen et al., EUROCRYPT 2023) in terms of prover efficiency. For a circuit size of $2^{24}$ where half the gates are additions, \(\mathsf{Pancake}\) achieves prover speedups of $1.67\times$ (single-threaded) and $2.43\times$ (32-threaded), while also generating smaller proofs and maintaining comparable verification time.
