# Abstract

> Private set intersection (PSI) protocols are an essential privacy-enhancing technology for many real-world use cases, ranging from mobile contact discovery to fraud detection. However, PSI executed directly between input parties can result in unreasonable performance overhead. This motivates the study of outsourced PSI, where clients delegate the heavy PSI operations to an untrusted (cloud) server.
> 
> In this SoK, we introduce a framework of 12 distinct properties that characterize outsourced PSI protocols based on security, functionality, and efficiency. By analyzing 20 protocols through this framework, we provide a valuable resource and an interactive tool for researchers and practitioners to select the most suitable protocols for their specific requirements. Finally, we discuss research gaps between trends in regular PSI and the current state of outsourced PSI, identifying promising avenues for future work.
