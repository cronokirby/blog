# Abstract

> Proof-carrying data (PCD) is a powerful cryptographic primitive for ensuring computational integrity in distributed settings. State-of-the-art PCD constructions based on accumulation schemes achieve practical prover efficiency and support a wide range of applications. However, realizing zero-knowledge for accumulation-based PCD remains challenging, particularly for high-degree relations. Existing solutions often incur substantial overhead due to the need for zero-knowledge in both the underlying non-interactive arguments of knowledge (NARKs) and accumulation schemes. In this work, we present new theoretical and practical improvements for zero-knowledge PCD. First, we propose a novel construction that eliminates the need for zero-knowledge NARKs by separating the compliance predicate and accumulation verification, thereby reducing proof size and improving efficiency. Second, we design an efficient zero-knowledge accumulation scheme for special sound protocols, introducing techniques such as masking vectors and zero-knowledge sum-check protocols to ensure privacy with minimal overhead. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that our construction achieves logarithmic proof size and verification time for d-degree NP relations, and outperforms existing solutions in both asymptotic and concrete complexity.
