# Abstract

> Secure and anonymous messaging has many compelling use-cases and is becoming increasingly 
> popular. In this paper, we consider it in the context of 
> delay-and-disruption-prone networks, which are characterized by 
> handicapped network access, disrupted operation, censorship, and intermittent network outages.
> 
> With such settings in mind, we define and design a Private Identity-Based Bulletin Board 
> (PIB^3) scheme, which allows users to anonymously post and retrieve messages to and from a 
> distributed database, and supports communication between users without pre-established 
> setup or pre-exchanged keys. Anyone can encrypt a message for an identity and public epoch, 
> such that only the party with the decryption key for that identity can identify, retrieve, 
> and decrypt the message. Against one corrupted non-colluding PIB^3 server, the server learns 
> neither the recipient identity nor the retrieved record indices beyond the leakage explicitly 
> modeled by the scheme: the public epoch, the database size, and the number of retrievals made 
> by the receiver. If retrieval-count privacy is required, retrievals can be padded to a fixed 
> bound. The multi-server construction extends this guarantee to larger server sets, and gives 
> coalition privacy whenever the underlying multi-server PIR scheme is private against the 
> corresponding coalition.
> 
> Contributions of this work are: (1) formally defining functionality and security requirements 
> for PIB^3-s, (2) defining and constructing a Hierarchical Identity-based Encryption (HIBE) scheme 
> with searchable ciphertexts, which serves as a building block for the proposed PIB^3 scheme and may be of independent interest, 
> (3) designing an efficient PIB^3 scheme that can be realized with $n\geq 2$ servers based on the 
> HIBE scheme with searchable ciphertexts combined with additional primitives, and (4) implementing 
> a functional PIB^3 prototype which demonstrates practicality of the entire concept and allows us 
> to assess its performance empirically.
