# Abstract

> This work presents a round optimal identity-based blind signature scheme based on module lattices. Our construction extends Fischlin's two-round blind signature framework [CRYPTO'06] to the identity-based setting. The construction uses the GPV signature scheme based on Micciancio and Peikert's G-trapdoor techniques and NIZK proofs [CRYPTO'22] in the random oracle model. The scheme is secure under the MLWE and MSIS assumptions. The optimised parameters are also provided targeting $128$-bit security. To the best of our knowledge, this scheme is the first-round optimal identity-based blind signature scheme whose security relies on module lattice problems.
