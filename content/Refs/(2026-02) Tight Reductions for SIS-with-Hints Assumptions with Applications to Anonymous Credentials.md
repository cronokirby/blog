# Abstract

> In this work, we investigate the landscape of emerging lattice-based assumptions tailored for anonymous credentials, focusing on variants of the Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem augmented with auxiliary hints. We provide a tight reduction from the Generalised ISISf (GenISISf) (Dubois et al., PKC 2025) assumption to its interactive variant IntGenISISf, enabling the construction of proof-friendly signature schemes without incurring the significant efficiency loss observed in prior works. In particular, our results directly apply to the anonymous credential scheme proposed by Bootle et al. (CRYPTO 2023), and circumvent the 4X blow-up in the credential size due to their security loss. We also identify families of functions f for which GenISISf is as hard as SIS, leading to the first (strongly) unforgeable standard-model signature scheme from SIS without relying on chameleon hash functions.
> 
> Moreover, we analyse the “one-more”-type lattice assumptions, showing in particular that Randomised One-More-ISIS (Baldimtsi et al., ASIACRYPT 2024) is at least as hard as standard One-More-ISIS (Agrawal et al., ACM CCS 2022). Further, we inspect different, yet equivalent, variations of Randomised One-More-ISIS which could be of independent interest. Finally, we compare the structural properties of GenISISf and One-More-ISIS, highlighting both shared techniques and fundamental differences. We believe our results contribute to a clearer understanding of the assumptions underpinning efficient, lattice-based anonymous credential systems.
