# Abstract

> We show that the secret sharing scheme   [Cryptogr. Commun. 16(1): 3-20 (2024)] cannot be put into practice.   (1) It confused the elements in a residue class ring modulo a prime $p$ with the points in an elliptic curve group over the finite field $F_p$. (2) It confused the underlying elliptic curve with the Lagrange interpolating curve,   and falsely requires the interpolating polynomial to   map a point on the elliptic curve to another point on the same elliptic curve.   (3)  It misuses the bit-wise XOR operator for the operands  with unequal bit-length, which results in the exposure of any participant's share,  and the loss of confidentiality.
