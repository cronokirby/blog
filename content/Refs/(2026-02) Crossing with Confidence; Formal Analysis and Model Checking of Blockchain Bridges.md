# Abstract

> We develop formal code-based security definitions for blockchain bridges and apply them to several bridge architectures deployed in practice. We derive both traditional pen-and-paper proofs and on the other, automated guarantees against bounded counterexamples. The latter is achieved via bounded model checking of our formally specified properties, implemented in Quint, a specification language and model checker closely related to TLA+.
> 
> Our definitions are expressed in a precise, code-based variant of the Universal Composition (UC) framework. This enables the modular use of hybrid functionalities—even for property-based definitions—and is essential for bounded model checking, where underlying primitives must be idealized.
> 
> Accordingly, we idealize and model-check all building blocks used in our protocols. Notably, we formulate a novel UC ideal functionality for Advanced Threshold Signatures (ATS) and modelcheck it for attacks to ensure its robustness
