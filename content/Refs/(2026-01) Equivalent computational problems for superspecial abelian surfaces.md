# Abstract

> We show reductions and equivalences between various problems related to the computation of the endomorphism ring of principally polarised superspecial abelian surfaces. Problems considered are the computation of the Ibukiyama-Katsura-Oort matrix and computation of unpolarised isomoprhisms between superspecial abelian surfaces.
