# Abstract

> We construct compilers to generically transform any dynamic Searchable Symmetric Encryption (DSSE) scheme that is secure against a semi-honest server into one that is secure against a malicious servers, thus yielding a Verifiable dynamic SSE (VDSSE). Our compilers achieve optimal overheads while preserving forward and backward privacy, which are the standard and widely accepted security notions for DSSE.
> 
> We focus on optimizing communication overheads and client storage requirements. Our first compiler $\mathsf{FLASH}$ incurs $O(1)$ communication overhead between the client and the server, which is optimal, while incurring mild storage overhead at the client. Our second compiler $\mathsf{BOLT}$ incurs $O(1)$ storage overhead at the client while incurring mild communication overhead. 
> Towards this, we define a new authenticated data structure called a set commitment and we provide an efficient instantiation of this primitive. 
> 
> We prototype implement our compilers and report on their performance over real-world databases. Our experiments validate that our compilers incur concretely low overheads on top of existing semi-honest DSSE schemes, and yield practically efficient VDSSE schemes that scale to very large databases.
