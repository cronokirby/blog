# Abstract

> Instant messaging services are an integral part of today's communication and their privacy has wide societal implications. Major messengers deploy end-to-end encryption, hiding message contents from the service provider. Group messaging, however, creates the challenge of also keeping the group membership list private.
> 
> The Signal messenger currently implements private group management using techniques inspired by Chase, Perrin, and Zaverucha (CCS 2020). Transitioning this system to quantum-safe turns out to be challenging: While one-to-one messaging can often adopt the newly standardized KEMs and signatures in a relatively direct way, private group management is more complex. Signal’s existing design heavily relies on the discrete-log structure to combine anonymous credentials, verifiable encryption, and oblivious PRFs for privacy and functionality. Quantum-safe versions of these components are unfortunately, typically far less efficient, requiring heavy zero-knowledge proofs and large communication per group operation. As a result, simply "swapping in" quantum-safe primitives is unlikely to yield an optimal protocol.
> 
> This paper reconsiders the design of the entire group system from the ground-up.  Our result is a scheme that possesses the same strong privacy guarantees, but is built in a more modular way using simpler underlying cryptographic building blocks that permit a more efficient quantum-safe instantiation.  The modularity of our protocol further allows for gradual migration to quantum-safe:  we can immediately transition components vulnerable to harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks (such as classical public-key encryption, computationally hiding commitments, etc.) while deferring the transition of other building blocks, such as authentication. 
> We prove our design secure in an extended security model that more comprehensively captures the rich feature set of Signal's group messaging system.
