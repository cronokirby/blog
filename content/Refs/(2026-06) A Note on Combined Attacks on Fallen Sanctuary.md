# Abstract

> Leakage-resilient rekeying schemes aim to maintain cryptographic security
> in the presence of side-channel leakage by periodically refreshing ephemeral keys
> before sufficient information can be accumulated by an adversary. Fallen Sanctuary
> (LR4) is a recent higher-order leakage-resilient rekeying construction that achieves
> exponential security amplification with respect to the number of primitive encryption
> invocations and the number of traces required to compromise the physical security
> of the implementation. Its security, however, relies on the correct maintenance of
> internal counters and cached intermediate keys that enforce the prescribed trace
> bounds.
> In this work, we investigate the security of LR4 under a combined fault and side-
> channel attack model. We show that transient faults targeting the counter-update
> and counter-validation mechanism can prevent the advancement of the rekeying state,
> causing repeated reuse of temporal keys that are intended to be short-lived. As a
> consequence, the bounded-trace assumptions underlying the LR4 security proof no
> longer hold. We demonstrate that an adversary can accumulate an arbitrary number
> of leakage traces corresponding to the same secret state, effectively reducing the
> security of the protected primitive to that of a conventional implementation without
> rekeying.
> We evaluate the attack on a fault simulated implementation and analyze its impact
> on the leakage-resilience guarantees claimed by LR4.
> Our findings emphasize that leakage-resilient rekeying schemes must consider fault-
> induced violations of state evolution assumptions in addition to conventional side-
> channel leakage.
