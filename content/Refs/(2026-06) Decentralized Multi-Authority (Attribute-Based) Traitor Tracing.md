# Abstract

> We initiate the study of multi-authority traitor tracing (MA-TT), a decentralized variant of traitor tracing in which tracing capabilities are distributed across multiple independent authorities rather than concentrated in a single trusted entity. Ciphertexts are associated with tracing policies over a collection of authorities, specifying which subsets of authorities are authorized to jointly accuse a user of contributing to a pirate decoder. This enables fine-grained control over tracing capabilities, prevents unilateral accusations, and reduces the surveillance risks inherent in centralized tracing systems. Our scheme naturally supports conjunction, disjunction, threshold, and more general monotone tracing policies.
> 
> We further introduce multi-authority attribute-based traitor tracing (MA-AB-TT), which combines distributed tracing in MA-TT with decentralized access control from multi-authority attribute-based encryption (MA-ABE). Ciphertexts are therefore equipped with two orthogonal policies: an attribute policy governing decryption and a tracing policy governing which tracing authorities may jointly identify traitors.
> 
> Our main contribution is a construction of MA-AB-TT for arbitrary monotone access structures from the standard matrix decisional Diffie-Hellman (MDDH) assumption in prime-order pairing groups. Our construction achieves adaptive security under static corruption of authorities in the random oracle model. All system parameters are independent of the number of authorities and users in the system, while ciphertexts grow linearly with the size of the associated policies. Our framework also yields a publicly traceable variant, in which tracing can be performed using only the authorities' public keys, albeit with weaker asymptotic efficiency guarantees.
> 
> Technically, we extend the blueprint for pairing-based traitor tracing based on private linear broadcast encryption (PLBE) [Boneh et al., Eurocrypt 2006] to the multi-authority setting. The key technical ingredient is a new multi-authority PLBE construction, which we instantiate from slotted inner-product function encryption (sIPFE) [Lin and Luo, Eurocrypt 2020]. As an intermediate step, we provide a new attribute-based sIPFE scheme supporting arithmetic branching programs, which may be of independent interest.
> 
> Our techniques also yield a new modular construction of adaptively secure MA-ABE under static corruptions from sIPFE, improving on a prior construction by Ambrona and Gay [PKC 2023]. Finally, when specialized to a single authority, our framework gives the first ciphertext-policy attribute-based traitor tracing scheme with asymptotically optimal parameters and exponentially large user spaces.
