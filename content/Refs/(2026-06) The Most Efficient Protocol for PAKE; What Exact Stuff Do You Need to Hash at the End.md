# Abstract

> A Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol allows two parties to jointly establish a cryptographic session key, in the "password-only" setting where the only information shared in advance is a low-entropy password. In recent years, the One-encryption EKE with 2-round Feistel cipher (OEKE-2F) protocol, a compiler from Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) to PAKE, has received much attention, for the following reasons: (1) When instantiated with the Diffie–Hellman KEM, it is the most computationally efficient PAKE protocol to date that is secure in the Universal Composability (UC) framework; and (2) When instantiated with a post-quantum KEM, it provides a generic way to construct efficient PAKE protocols based on post-quantum assumptions.
> 
> Unfortunately, the community cannot agree upon what the OEKE-2F protocol exactly is: part of the second protocol message is an RO hash of the KEM key, together with any number of the following:
> 
> - The password,
> - The KEM public key,
> - The first protocol message, and
> - The KEM ciphertext.
> 
> This yields 16 potential variants of OEKE-2F; only two of them have been studied in the literature, and their pros and cons are poorly understood.

> In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of *all 16 variants* of OEKE-2F, proving the UC-security of each of them. The general takeaway is that the "hash everything" version requires the fewest security properties of the underlying KEM scheme, and the more items we remove from the hash, the more security requirements the KEM scheme has to satisfy — although all of the additional KEM properties are still mild. We pinpoint the exact KEM properties each version of OEKE-2F needs, and thoroughly explain the rationales.
> 
> The significance of this work lies in that it helps the community converge upon the "right" version of OEKE-2F, and perhaps also in that this is the first paper by the author that is over 100 pages.
