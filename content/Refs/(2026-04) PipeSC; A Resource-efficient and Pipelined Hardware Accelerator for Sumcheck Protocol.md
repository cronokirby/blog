# Abstract

> Zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) are cryptographic protocols that allow a prover to convince verifiers of the correctness of a statement without revealing any additional information. 
> Recent zk-SNARK constructions have shifted from univariate to multivariate polynomial-based designs, reducing the proving complexity from quasilinear to linear by avoiding costly univariate polynomial interpolation. 
> This shift, however, makes the sumcheck protocol—a core primitive for verifying polynomial relations over the Boolean hypercube—the dominant component in the prover’s workload.
> Consequently, the iterative nature and intensive intermediate data movement of the sumcheck protocol introduce severe performance bottlenecks in CPU- and GPU-based implementations, especially for large-scale multivariate polynomials.
> 
> In this paper, we present PipeSC, a resource-efficient, ASIC-based accelerator for sumcheck. 
> PipeSC combines deep pipelining, modular-multiplier reuse, and a finite-state machine-based dependency scheduler to sustain high utilization of computational resources across phases of the protocol.
> In addition, we introduce an Equality-MLE generation module that employs hierarchical scheduling and multiplier reuse, yielding a unified hardware substrate shared by multiple proving subroutines.
> 
> Against state-of-the-art CPU, GPU, and ASIC implementations, 
> PipeSC delivers up to \textbf{5.02$\times$} speedup over the GPU implementation and up to \textbf{2756.2$\times$} speedup over the CPU implementation, while improving the area–time product (ATP) by up to \textbf{3.68$\times$} compared with the ASIC design.
> These results show that careful hardware–algorithm co-design and conflict-free scheduling substantially accelerate sumcheck, paving the way for fully integrated zk-SNARK hardware pipelines.
