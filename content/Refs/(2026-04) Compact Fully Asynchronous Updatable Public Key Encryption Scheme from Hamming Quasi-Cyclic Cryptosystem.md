# Abstract

> In this work, we propose the first code-based $\mathsf{uPKE}$ from the hamming quasi-cyclic public key encryption scheme $(\mathsf{hqcPKE})$ of Gaborit et al. by integrating an efficient key-update mechanism utilizing a carefully designed deterministic sampling algorithm. Our sampling algorithm exploits a structured permutation set preserving Hamming weight and satisfying specific algebraic properties that is of independent interest. More positively, our protocol allows unbounded key updates free from the cumulative error issues inheriant to lattice based designs and supports asynchronous key updates, authorizing senders to update the public key independently. We formally establish the security of the proposed construction against indistinguishability under chosen-randomness and chosen-plaintext attack $(\mathsf{IND}\text{-}\mathsf{CR}\text{-}\mathsf{CPA})$ in standard model considering decisional quasi-cyclic syndrome decoding with parity $(\mathsf{DQCSDP})$ assumption. We emphasize that  in comparison with existing post-quantum secure asynchronous schemes supporting unbounded updates, our construction achieves in the standard model instead of random oracle model significantly improved storage and communication efficiency, particularly in terms of public key size, ciphertext size and update ciphertext size. From a computational perspective, our design enables a more efficient public key update procedure and exhibits comparable performance for key generation, encryption, decryption and secret key update.
