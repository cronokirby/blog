# Abstract

> Secure group messaging protocols, now standardized by the IETF as Messaging Layer Security (MLS), provide end-to-end encryption for billions of users. The cryptographic core of these protocols is continuous group key agreement (CGKA), a primitive designed to maintain a shared secret among a dynamic group while providing security guarantees like forward secrecy and post-compromise security. A critical challenge for CGKA is achieving efficiency, particularly sublinear complexity (in the size of the group), for group operations. While practical tree-based protocols like TreeKEM offer logarithmic complexity in ideal (so-called "fair-weather") scenarios, their performance degrades to linear in the worst-case, and even realistic average-case, scenarios. This performance collapse raises the fundamental question of whether any CGKA protocol can achieve provably sublinear worst-case complexity.
> 
> Prior work has established significant barriers to this goal, including black-box impossibility results ruling out efficient constructions from standard public-key encryption. Theoretical solutions circumvent these barriers using powerful tools like indistinguishability obfuscation ($i\mathcal{O}$), but these constructions are astronomically inefficient and often provide weaker security guarantees, such as lacking forward secrecy. This leaves a wide gap between practical protocols with poor worst-case guarantees and theoretical solutions that are entirely impractical.
> 
> In this paper, we narrow this gap by presenting the first CGKA protocol that achieves provably logarithmic worst-case complexity for both computation and communication. Our first construction is based on a falsifiable and plausibly post-quantum assumption called decomposed learning with errors (decomposed LWE), and achieves basic CGKA security (only group members know the key) and post-compromise security, but not forward secrecy. We then show how to extend our scheme in the random oracle model to achieve optimal security (including forward secrecy) while retaining worst-case sublinear communication. However, the forward-secure refresh operation takes linear time in the group size, while still producing compact ciphertexts.

> Our work is the first to establish that worst-case efficient CGKA is theoretically possible from simple falsifiable assumptions. Moreover, it offers a plausible roadmap towards concretely efficient constructions.
