# Abstract

> An anonymous credential allows a user to prove that she is authorized in an anonymous and unlinkable fashion.  A rate-limited token is an anonymous credential that can only be used a limited number of times in any particular context; this means that even though we do not know which users are gaining access to a resource, there is a limit to how many resources one user may consume.  Such tokens are becoming an increasingly attractive way to balance privacy with authorized access. Although a general architecture for how to obtain rate-limited tokens from digital signatures, pseudorandom functions (PRFs), and non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (NIZKs) has been known for over twenty years, efficiently instantiating it with post-quantum-secure signatures and proofs has, until now, remained an open problem.  
> 
> In this work, we present the first lattice-based construction of rate-limited tokens and tackle the practical challenges associated with using lattice-based building blocks in this setting. A central difficulty lies in the absence of lattice-based PRFs that support efficient NIZK proofs of correct evaluation. We show that, in the random oracle model, a weak PRF—where adversaries are restricted to querying random inputs—suffices. We further present a weak PRF construction that both admits efficient NIZK proofs and remains secure—even when adversaries have partial control over the randomness—and extend this guarantee more generally to key-homomorphic PRFs.
> 
> Another contribution, which is of independent interest, is the first lattice-based construction of partially binding commitments, a primitive introduced by Goel et al. (Eurocrypt 2022) that was previously known only under discrete-log assumptions. We give a practical construction that enables succinct disjunctive proofs via a variant of the self-stacking compiler of Goel et al. Along the way, we develop a new technique for batching CNF proofs of $\Sigma$-protocols, which allows one to efficiently prove that a value is the output of a PRF on one of a set of inputs. As a direct application, this yields logarithmic-size lattice-based ring signatures based on Fiat–Shamir-with-Aborts $\Sigma$-protocols (Lyubashevsky, Eurocrypt 2012).
> 
> Finally, we observe for the first time that the anonymous counting tokens of Benhamouda, Raykova, and Seth (Asiacrypt 2023) can be obtained from anonymous rate-limited tokens. This yields a construction whose communication complexity is independent of the number of tokens that need to be issued.
