# Abstract

> Registered attribute-based encryption (Reg-ABE) is a new variant of attribute-based encryption (ABE) that was introduced to resolve the notorious key escrow problem.
> In a Reg-ABE system, there is no authority that generates secret keys, and each user joins the system by generating its own public/secret key pair.
> Because of its public-key infrastructure-like model and versatile access control functionality, Reg-ABE is a promising alternative of ABE.
> In this work, we present a highly space efficient non-monotone Reg-ABE scheme with strong security.
> Specifically, the sizes of MPK and ciphertext of our scheme are both about 7.5KB, which could be more than 2000$ \times $ and 5$ \times $ smaller than those of the state-of-the-art scheme by Garg \textit{et al.}~(Crypto'24, GLWW), respectively, in a realistic parameter setting.
> The sizes of other elements such as helper secret key and a state that the system maintains could also become more than 40$ \times $ smaller.
> Furthermore, our scheme supports non-monotone policies and CCA-security, neither of which GLWW supports.
> We implement our scheme together with GLWW and show that encryption of ours outperforms that of GLWW even with the above features, while decryption of ours is a few times less efficient than that of GLWW but still takes less than 0.1 seconds with a laptop.
> Our scheme is proven secure in the generic group model.
> We also present a dual system variant of our main scheme, which is CPA-secure under the MDDH assumption in the plain model.
> The variant is much simpler and more efficient than the only known non-monotone Reg-ABE scheme by Attrapadung \textit{et al.}~(Crypto'24).
