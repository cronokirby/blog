# Abstract

> We present an active attack against the PEARL-SCALLOP group action. Modelling Alice as an oracle that outputs the action by a secret ideal class on suitably chosen oriented elliptic curves, we show how to recover the secret using a handful of oracle calls (four for the parameter set targeting a security level equivalent to CSIDH-1024), by reducing to the computation of moderately-sized group action discrete logarithms. The key ingredient to the attack is to employ curves with non-primitive orientations inherent to the PEARL-SCALLOP construction. We provide methods for public-key validation — that is, for deciding whether a given orientation is primitive — and discuss their practicality.
