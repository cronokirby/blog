# Abstract

> This paper presents the first blind signature scheme in a pairing-free group with the following properties: (1) the signing protocol consists of only three moves; (2) the proof of one-more unforgeability relies solely on the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption in the Random Oracle Model (ROM); and (3) the construction makes only black-box use of the underlying group. This resolves a major open problem in the area, as all prior pairing-free blind signatures either additionally relied on the Algebraic Group Model (AGM) or required at least four moves. Moreover, a recent lower bound by Dietz et al. (ePrint, '26) shows that three moves are optimal for such constructions.

> Both the communication complexity and the signature size in our scheme consist of a constant number of group elements. Our construction in fact achieves strong one-more unforgeability (which was not known for any of the recent AGM-free constructions requiring four moves), and we also present a partially blind variant. Furthermore, blindness is statistical (in the ROM). Our approach is based on a new construction paradigm that combines a conventional (yet, by itself, not fully secure) blind signature scheme (specifically, the blind Okamoto-Schnorr scheme) with a carefully crafted algebraic MAC.
