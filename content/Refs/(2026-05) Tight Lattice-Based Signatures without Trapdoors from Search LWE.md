# Abstract

> The study of digital signatures with tight reductions has attracted considerable attention over the past two decades, as such schemes inherit essentially the same quantitative hardness as the underlying computational problem. In the context of lattice-based cryptography, the GPV approach (Gentry, Peikert, and Vaikuntanathan, STOC ’08) admits a simple tight reduction from the SIS problem, but relies on preimage sampling via trapdoors, which often leads to complex and brittle implementations. By contrast, tight proofs for trapdoor-free constructions, following the Fiat–Shamir paradigm, necessarily rely on decisional assumptions, most notably the decisional LWE assumption. From the perspective of concrete security, however, reliance on a search assumption is preferable, as known search-to-decision reductions for LWE provide only weak quantitative guarantees.

> This paper presents the first efficient lattice-based signature scheme with a tight reduction to a search assumption (namely, the hardness of the search LWE problem) that does not require any trapdoor in the scheme itself (but merely uses, instead, a trapdoor in the proof). Our construction follows the Fiat-Shamir paradigm and can be viewed as a lattice analogue of Chevallier–Mames signatures (CRYPTO ’05). Establishing security in the lattice setting, however, requires overcoming significant technical obstacles: in particular, our proof develops several new techniques to cope with the inherently weak soundness guarantees of lattice-based interactive proofs.
