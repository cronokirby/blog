# Abstract

> Approximate Agreement (AA) is a relaxation of consensus that requires honest parties to output values that are close and within the honest inputs' range. Introduced as a relaxation of exact consensus, AA has become a versatile primitive with applications from blockchain oracles to cyber-physical systems.
> This paper provides a systematization of knowledge (SoK) on byzantine-resilient AA in complete networks.
> 
> We mainly focus on the real-valued variant, and chart the feasibility frontiers in synchronous, asynchronous, and network-agnostic models. We compare protocols in terms of resilience, round complexity, and communication efficiency, while also clarifying overlooked details and gaps.
> 
> Beyond standard requirements on the outputs, we discuss stronger conditions, such as having the outputs \emph{close} to the honest inputs' median. Moreover, we briefly situate the real-valued AA problem within the broader landscape of AA, where other input domains such as higher-dimensional spaces and graphs introduce further challenges.
