# Abstract

> This short paper formally specifies and analyzes the UG hybrid KEM construction from the IRTF CFRG’s recent draft on hybrid (post-quantum/traditional) KEMs. The UG construction is an optimized hybrid of a Diffie-Hellman (DH)-based KEM in a nominal group and a generic IND-CCA KEM. The main optimization is that the group elements derived in the DH-based KEM are “inlined” in the key derivation, saving unnecessary hashing. We perform two security analyses of the UG construction: one shows UG is IND-CCA even if the generic IND-CCA KEM is broken; the other complementary analysis shows UG is IND-CCA even if the DH assumptions in the nominal group are broken (by, e.g., a cryptographically-relevant quantum computer).
