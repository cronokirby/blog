# Abstract

> A non-interactive secure computation (NISC) protocol allows a client with input $x$ and a server with input $y$ to compute $f(x,y)$ using a single message from the client and a single response from the server. The protocol is called succinct if the size of the server’s message depends only on the output length and is independent of the size of $y$ and the complexity of $f$. In the semi-honest setting, succinct NISC is known from fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). In contrast, malicious security is currently known only from non-standard assumptions, such as SNARKs for NP.
> 
> In this work, we construct maliciously secure succinct NISC protocols for natural and widely studied functionalities from standard assumptions, namely, FHE and batch arguments (BARGs). Our first result is a protocol for private set membership (PSM): the client holds an element $x$, the server holds a large set $S$, and the function outputs $1$ if and only if $x \in S$. We then give several generalizations:
> - Dictionary lookup: The server holds a dictionary $D$ of key–value pairs, the client’s input is a key $k$, and the output is $D[k]$.
> - Verifiable dictionary lookup: The server’s dictionary must additionally satisfy a predicate $P$, computable by a read-once machine with small state.
> - UP search: The client input is an instance $x$, and the output is $D[w]$, where $w$ is the unique witness for $x$ under some UP relation.
> 
> Our protocols achieve split-simulation security against a malicious server and standard security against a malicious client. Split-simulation is a relaxation of the standard real-ideal paradigm, where correctness of the client’s output and indistinguishability of the server’s view are guaranteed separately.
> 
> At the heart of our results lies a new simulation technique in which the server’s large input is extracted piece by piece and reconstructed into a coherent input. This reconstruction is enabled by a new monotone coupling argument based on Strassen’s theorem.
