[[Philip Roth]]'s take on [[Franz Kafka|Kafka's]] [[Die Verwandlung|Die Verwandlung (The Metamorphosis)]], wherein the protagonist finds himself transformed not into a human-sized cockroach, but a human-sized breast.

A very comical story, with the typical sexual obsessions that Roth's protagonists tend to have, especially in this era ([[(1969) Portnoy's Complaint|Portnoy's Complaint]] was only written a few years back). The neuroticisms of the main character are on full display, their plight against their absurd condition reaches pathetic lows, all of which is portrayed in a comic way. The story is genuinely quite funny, and very engaging.

The story has a surprisingly compelling narrative arc about coming to terms with grief, and with "tragedy". Our main character goes through different stages of grief over their transformation: shock, depression, denial, madness, peace. These psychological states are captured quite well through an emotive first person narration.

You could transpose the grief the main character overcomes to being about, e.g. finding themselves paralyzed---rather than finding themselves comically transformed into a human breast---and it would play as a very serious story, sold exclusively at the finest airport kiosks across the country.

The length and pacing of this story are perfect as well. Overall, an excellently executed piece of writing, with a mainly comic, but also, at times, philosophical appeal.
