# Abstract

> The rapid progress of quantum computing threatens widely deployed
> public-key cryptosystems such as RSA and Diffie–Hellman, accelerating
> the transition toward post-quantum cryptography (PQC).
> During this migration, hybrid key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs)
> that combine classical and post-quantum primitives are strongly
> recommended by standardization bodies and cybersecurity agencies.
> However, existing hybrid designs mainly focus on combining
> post-quantum KEMs with Diffie–Hellman–style constructions, while the
> systematic integration of standardized classical public-key encryption
> (PKE) schemes with post-quantum KEMs remains largely unexplored.
> 
> In this work, we introduce two generic hybrid constructions,
> $\mathsf{HybKEM}$ and $\mathsf{HybKEM}^{*}$, that combine a classical
> PKE scheme with a post-quantum KEM satisfying ciphertext
> second-preimage resistance (C2PRI).
> We prove that both constructions achieve IND-CCA security in the
> standard model. The refined construction $\mathsf{HybKEM}^{*}$ additionally relies on a
> new security notion of the classical PKE scheme, termed
> partial ciphertext second-preimage resistance (PC2PRI), which captures
> second-preimage resistance when a designated ciphertext component is
> fixed.
> This new property enables shared-key derivation from only a designated PKE ciphertext component in $\mathsf{HybKEM}^{*}$, leading to improved efficiency.
> Finally, we provide a systematic analysis of the PC2PRI property for several standardized classical encryption schemes, including ECIES, PSEC, and SM2.
