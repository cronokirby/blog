# Abstract

> Decentralized lending protocols rely on liquidation mechanisms tied to volatile oracle-derived prices, creating cascading systemic risk during market downturns. We introduce debt-aware discrete bonding curves (DABC)—piecewise-linear bonding curves with a distinguished floor segment whose price is provably non-decreasing. A reserve invariant couples the curve’s collateral to outstanding debt, enabling a credit facility for issuance-native collateral in which borrowing capacity is anchored to the endogenous floor price rather than a market oracle. We prove that no loan originated at or below the floor-anchored LTV can become under-collateralized due to collateral price declines—eliminating protocol-triggered liquidation for this borrowing model. The trade-off: non-repayment results in permanent token lock, not forced sale. By internalizing issuance, trading, and borrowing in a single contract, the mechanism captures fee revenue that would otherwise accrue to external parties, directing it toward floor elevation. A recursive buy-lock-borrow-buy loop enables leveraged positions without liquidation risk; token launches are the most compelling application. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first fully formalized treatment in which borrowing safety is derived from a debt-aware reserve invariant and a provably non-decreasing endogenous floor price. We verify the mechanism through stateful fuzz testing and formal verification of a concrete Solidity implementation.
