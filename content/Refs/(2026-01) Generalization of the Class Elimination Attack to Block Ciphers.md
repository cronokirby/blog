# Abstract

> This work extends the methodology of the Class Elimination Attack (CEA) and the Reference Identities (RI/GRI) used in cryptanalysis for its application to block ciphers like AES and complex SPN variants. Probabilistic results concerning the partitioned key space are generalized to algebraic structures defined over finite fields $ \mathbb{F}_{2^n} $, linking them to the cipher's diffusion and confusion properties. Theorems establishing upper bounds for the expected number of classes to explore as a function of the diffusion capacity are proposed, and a parameterized complexity analysis is provided. The results offer a theoretical framework for evaluating the resistance of symmetric ciphers against attacks based on genetic algorithms and partition optimization.
