# Abstract

> Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments (zkSNARGs) are SNARGs in which the proof reveals nothing except the validity of the claim. zkSNARGs for NP can be constructed generically from SNARGs for NP using a Non-interactive Zero-knowledge (NIZK) proof, but this transformation uses either the NIZK or the SNARG in a non-black-box way.
> 
> We design a new SNARGs-to-zkSNARGs transformation that is conceptually different from the NIZK+SNARG approach. Our transformation is inspired by the elegant construction of succinct interactive ZK arguments of Ishai, Mahmoody and Sahai (TCC`12) which combines a cryptographic hash function with an information theoretic ZK proof system (specifically, a Probabilistically-Checkable Proof).
> Our construction takes a first step towards fully black-box (BB) zkSNARG constructions: it uses the underlying SNARG as a black-box (though the other cryptographic components are used in a non-BB way). Our transformation is applicable to SNARGs for sub-classes of NP: batched NP computations (i.e., BARGs); and languages that have computational non-signaling PCPs, which contains NTISP (non-deterministic bounded space).
> 
> As a corollary, we get zkBARGs for NP, and zkSNARGs for NTISP, from the Learning With Errors (LWE) assumption. Thus, our results give a scaled-down version of the zkSNARGs-to-SNARGs reduction for NP, showing that by restricting to a sub-class of NP, the zkSNARG construction can be based on standard assumptions. 
> 
> A main ingredient underlying our transformation is a new commitment primitive, called Hiding Somewhere-Extractable commitment (HSE), which we introduce and construct based on LWE. This commitment primitive enhances somewhere statistically-binding hash functions (Hubáček and Wichs, ITCS 2015) to also guarantee hiding, and could be of independent interest.
