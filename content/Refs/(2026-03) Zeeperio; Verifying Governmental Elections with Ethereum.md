# Abstract

> Scantegrity II became the first governmental election run with a cryptographic end-to-end election verification (E2E-V) protocol. 
> E2E-V protocols allow the public to verify proofs that the election was executed correctly, but participation in this important process is largely left as an opt-in, ad hoc exercise. We present Zeeperio, a special purpose zk-SNARK argument (built with application-specific arithmetization) that can issue proofs for Scantegrity elections that can be verified automatically via smart contracts for inexpensive on-chain verification. A Zeeperio verification contract running on Ethereum costs under $30 USD (at time of writing) per election (and the cost is constant in the number of ballots). By not relying on general purpose zk-SNARK toolkits, like circuit or zkVM compilers, Zeeperio's tailor-made argument offers multiple order-of-magnitude improvements to prover efficiency over implementations from the research literature. For example, Zeeperio requires under 5 hours on a commodity laptop for an election with 100,000 ballots to produce a proof in the kilobyte range.
