# Abstract

> We present the first practical, round-optimal blind signatures in pairing-free groups.  
> We build on the Fischlin paradigm (EUROCRYPT 2007) where a first signature is computed on a commitment to the message and the final signature is a zero-knowledge proof of the first signature. 
> We use the Nyberg-Rueppel signature scheme as the basis (CCS 1993), it is a well-studied scheme with a verification equation that is sufficiently algebraic to allow efficient proofs, that do not need to make non-black box use of a random oracle. 
> Our construction offers flexibility for trade-offs between underlying assumptions and supports issuance of signatures on vectors of attributes making it suitable for use in anonymous credential systems.   
> As a building block, we show how existing NIZKs can be modified to  allow for straight-line extraction.
> We implement variants of our construction to demonstrate its practicality, varying the choice of elliptic curve and the proof system used to compute the NIZK. 
> With conservative parameters (NIST-P256 and SHA-256) and targeting short proofs, signatures are 1349 bytes long, and on a typical laptop can be generated in under 500ms and verified in under 100ms.
