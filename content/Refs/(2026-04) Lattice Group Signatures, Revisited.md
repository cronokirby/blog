# Abstract

> Group signatures are one of the central privacy-preserving authentication mechanisms, offering an interesting trade-off between accountability and anonymity. Their versatility has led to many applications and even standardization at ISO/IEC. Unfortunately, they lack so far efficient quantum-safe constructions, despite several works implementing the seminal framework by Bellare, Micciancio and Warinschi (BMW) in the lattice setting.
> In this work, we propose an alternative lattice-based construction that departs from the BMW blueprint by trying to minimize the number of elements to conceal in zero-knowledge proofs, the latter being quite complex in this setting. Concretely, it relies on delegated lattice bases, while avoiding the complex OR-proofs of some previous attempts in that direction. Combined with some tricks leveraging the peculiarities of a recent lattice sampler, it results in an efficient scheme that yet retains all the BMW security properties while only relying on standard lattice assumptions.
