# Abstract

> The transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is constrained by the limited cryptanalytic history of individual PQC algorithms. Hybrid constructions, which combine several primitives so that breaking the hybrid requires breaking each component, address this concern directly. This paper presents Cobra, a hybrid Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM)
> that integrates FrodoKEM (unstructured LWE), ML-KEM (FIPS 203 module-LWE), HQC (code-based), and a Dummy KEM for agility, and analyses all 15 mathematically distinct composition methods spanning parallel, cascading, multi-stage, and nested topologies. We prove that every Cobra method achieves IND-CCA2 security within the MarketTheoretic Security Framework (MTSF), which subsumes and strictly extends both Universal Composability and the Random Oracle Model. An explicit 10-round bidding-round chain per method yields post-quantum ask prices of approximately 2−127 at NIST Level 1 together
> with composability under arbitrary TLS 1.3 embeddings, per-session CNF auditing, and unbounded-session security via pinging. Although all fifteen methods are security-equivalent, encapsulation latency varies by 3.2× (1.2–3.8 ms) and Theorem 7.1 reduces deployment
> selection to a Pareto-optimal set of five archetypes. Three real-world TLS 1.3 case studies (financial, healthcare, government) confirm the prediction, with infrastructure overhead
> clustering at 15–22% across sectors.
