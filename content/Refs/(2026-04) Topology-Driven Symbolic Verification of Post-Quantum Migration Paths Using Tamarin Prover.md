# Abstract

> The transition from classical public-key cryptography to post-quantum
> cryptography introduces protocol-level risks that are not fully addressed
> by configuration review, performance benchmarking, or endpoint reachability
> testing. Under the current abstraction, deployments may appear operationally
> correct while still permitting secrecy, authentication, or forward-secrecy
> violations at the protocol level. This paper presents a topology-driven
> symbolic verification workflow that translates distributed-system
> communication graphs into Tamarin models for analysis under the Dolev--Yao
> adversary model. The workflow derives protocol roles, communication
> constraints, and migration policies from a graph-based deployment
> representation, producing .spthy models and associated lemmas for
> executability, secrecy, authentication, and forward secrecy. A canonical
> topology representation is used to ensure deterministic model generation
> from semantically equivalent graph inputs. Experimental evaluation across
> five scenarios indicates that the framework produces discriminative symbolic
> outcomes rather than uniform failure reports. A registration-only control
> scenario verifies all reported lemmas, while the remaining scenarios exhibit
> two distinct falsification patterns: secrecy and forward-secrecy failures in
> three scenarios, and authentication failure in one scenario. These results
> indicate that symbolic verification provides a complementary assurance layer
> for post-quantum migration analysis and can reveal protocol-level risks that
> are not observable through operational testing alone.
