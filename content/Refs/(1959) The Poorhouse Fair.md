A day in the life of an retirement home, where they try and put on a fair, is depicted. The tensions between the elderly and their younger caretakers are highlighted.

The characters in this novel are the most interesting part. There's a varied cast, and their interactions, especially across generations, are well depicted, and serve as a good vantage point for philosophical digression. The use of different points of view is done excellently, and does let you get into the head of the different actors quite well.

The descriptions are vivid, precise, and concise. At times, they feel a bit sparse though. I would have liked a bit more energy and color to the scenes, which can feel a bit undressed.

There's a bit of amateurishness to [[John Updike|Updike's]] first novel, but it's not to the point where you would suspect it to be a debut. The plot is weak, the themes are not quite fully developed, and there are loose threads in the world-building. These issues get ironed out by the time of the subsequent novel [[(1960) Rabbit, Run]]. It's interesting to see how [[John Updike|Updike]] improves even after so little time.
