# Abstract

> We revisit the notion of PViO [Jain-Jin, FOCS’22] – an indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) scheme for Turing machines with unbounded input length that guarantees security for pairs of machines whose equivalence can be proven in Cook’s Theory PV.
> 
> Known constructions of PViO require subexponentially-hard iO for circuits. We give the first construction based on polynomially-hard iO and other standard assumptions. We further show how to replace iO with EFiO – an efficiently falsifiable variant, thus obtaining a construction based on efficiently falsifiable assumptions.
> 
> Central to our result is a new twist to the celebrated punctured programming technique [Sahai-Waters, STOC’14], where one can program an obfuscated probabilistic function on its entire input domain in one shot instead of an input-by-input manner. Our key ingredient is the notion of function secret sharing [Boyle-Gilboa-Ishai, EUROCRYPT’15]. We further show the versatility of our technique by removing the use of complexity-leveraging in two applications of iO: unleveled fully homomorphic encryption, and adaptively-sound succinct non-interactive arguments for “trapdoor” languages.
