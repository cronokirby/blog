# Abstract

> The post-quantum signature scheme Falcon (FN-DSA), currently being standardized by NIST as FIPS 206 (Initial Public Draft submitted August 2025, final standard expected 2026-2027), relies on a discrete Gaussian sampler whose critical bottleneck is the function fpr_expm_p63, computing $\lfloor \exp(-x) \cdot 2^{63} \rfloor$ for $x \in [0, \ln 2)$. While the reference implementation already employs a degree-12 fixed-point polynomial (FACCT), no segmented approximation has been studied for this specific function, nor has empirical timing security been published on ARM Cortex-M3 (emulated or physical).
> 
> This paper presents a systematic study of piecewise polynomial approximation applied to fpr_expm_p63, combining the Remez exchange algorithm (computed with 50 decimal digits of precision via mpmath), fixed-point arithmetic, and Horner evaluation. Two configurations are implemented and evaluated: a 32-segment degree-6 approximation at scale $2^{62}$ targeting x86-64, and a 16-segment degree-3 approximation at scale $2^{31}$ (256-byte LUT) targeting ARM Cortex-M3 IoT devices without hardware floating-point unit (FPU).
> 
> Against the authentic FACCT reference from Falcon's fpr.c, ported verbatim to ARM Cortex-M3 (emulated via QEMU user-mode with arm-linux-gnueabi -mfloat-abi=soft), our implementation achieves a $1.28\times$ median speedup across 30 independent runs (range $1.24\times$ to $1.33\times$), measured with a rigorous anti-noise protocol combining batch measurement, aggressive warm-up, ref/opt interleaving, and percentile filtering (P5-P95). DUDECT timing leakage tests confirm that both the FACCT reference (t-score $\in [0.05, 2.51]$) and our implementation (t-score $\in [1.99, 5.24]$) remain within statistical safety thresholds in the vast majority of runs (FACCT: 30/30; optimized: 27/30). Static instruction-level analysis via objdump disassembly provides deterministic constant-time evidence: zero data-dependent conditional branches, zero FPU instructions, and zero soft-float calls, yielding a branchless fixed-point Horner core; however, the full constant-time claim is limited to the tested compilation target and memory model.
> 
> To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first comparative study of segmented versus global polynomial approximation for fpr_expm_p63 in the FN-DSA context, and the first empirical DUDECT measurement of this function on emulated ARM Cortex-M3 against the authentic FACCT reference. Physical hardware validation on STM32F103 is identified as future work.
