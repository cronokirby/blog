# Abstract

> Blockchain networks rely on transaction fees for resource allocation and spam prevention. Ethereum's gas mechanism and its adoption by Layer-2 rollups serve this dual purpose, but gas-based fee markets produce unintended consequences: ineffective spam deterrence at low fee levels, poor user experience, privacy leakage, and revenue instability for rollup operators.
> We present an idealized protocol architecture for gasless sequencer admission in Ethereum Layer-2 rollups based on Rate-Limiting Nullifiers (RLN) and a non-transferable reputation token (Karma). Users transact within a per-epoch gasless quota. Transactions beyond that quota use a gas-paid overflow path. RLN enforces the quota via zero-knowledge membership proofs, preserving pseudonymity for users within quota against on-chain observers while exposing violators through reputation slashing.
> We present the architecture and transaction flow, analyze spam-attack economics through a parameterized cost comparison on a flat per-identity quota model (labeled flat-$N$, an analysis model for the spam stress test), and describe Status Network (SN), a deployed Ethereum L2 that implements this design.
