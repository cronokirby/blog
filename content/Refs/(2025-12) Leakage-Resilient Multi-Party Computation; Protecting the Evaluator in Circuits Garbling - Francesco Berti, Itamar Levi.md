# Abstract

> Garbling schemes allow two parties to compute a
> joint function on private inputs without revealing them. Yet,
> a semi-honest garbler might exploit hardware/software sidechannel
> leakages from the evaluator. An alarming threat with
> no concrete solution yet. Using the homomorphic properties of
> ElGamal encryption, we can prevent such leakage-based attacks.
