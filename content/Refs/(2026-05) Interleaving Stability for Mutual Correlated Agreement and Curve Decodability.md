# Abstract

> We prove that row-wise interleaving does not impose a linear loss on two
> coding-theoretic soundness properties used in recent IOP/SNARK analyses:
> generator mutual correlated agreement and curve decodability.
> 
> For generator-MCA, let $G:\Omega\to\mathbb{F}_q^\ell$ be a coefficient
> generator over a finite seed set and let $C$ be an $\mathbb{F}_q$-additive
> code. For every interleaving width $s$ and distance parameter $\delta$, we show
> $$
>   \varepsilon_G(C,\delta)
>   \le
>   \varepsilon_G(C^{\equiv s},\delta)
>   \le
>   \left(1+\frac1q+\cdots+\frac1{q^{s-1}}\right)\varepsilon_G(C,\delta).
> $$
> Moreover, if $|\Omega|\le q$, then the transfer is exact:
> $$
>   \varepsilon_G(C^{\equiv s},\delta)=\varepsilon_G(C,\delta).
> $$
> In particular, affine-line MCA is invariant under row-wise interleaving. This
> answers the known interleaving-loss question and removes the linear
> interleaving factor from the affine-line MCA bound. It also implies that
> polynomial-generator MCA bounds transfer to interleaved codes without an
> additional interleaving-width factor.
> 
> We further establish interleaving stability for curve decodability. We
> introduce a marked formulation, prove its equivalence to the standard
> definition for $\mathbb{F}_q$-additive codes and $1\le b\le a\le q$, and use it
> to transfer curve decodability to row-wise interleavings. If $C$ is
> $(\ell,\delta,a,b)$-curve-decodable and $\binom{a}{b}\le q$, then
> $C^{\equiv s}$ is also $(\ell,\delta,a,b)$-curve-decodable for every $s$. We
> also give a field-size-weighted variant that transfers larger base-code
> witness parameters to smaller interleaved-code witness parameters.
