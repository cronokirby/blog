# Abstract

> We study the implications of the existence of weak Zero-Knowledge (ZK) protocols for worst-case hard languages. These are protocols that have completeness, soundness, and zero-knowledge errors (denoted $\epsilon_c$, $\epsilon_s$, and $\epsilon_z$, respectively) that might not be negligible. Under the assumption that there are worst-case hard languages in NP, we show the following:
> 
> 1. If all languages in NP have NIZK proofs or arguments satisfying $ \epsilon_c+\epsilon_s+\epsilon_z < 1 $, then One-Way Functions (OWFs) exist.  
> 
>  This covers all possible non-trivial values for these error rates. It additionally implies that if all languages in NP have such NIZK proofs and ec is negligible, then they also have NIZK proofs where all errors are negligible. Previously, these results were known under the more restrictive condition $ \epsilon_c+\sqrt{\epsilon_s}+\epsilon_z < 1 $ [Chakraborty et al., CRYPTO 2025]. 
> 
> 2. If all languages in NP have k-round public-coin ZK proofs or arguments satisfying $ \epsilon_c+\epsilon_s+(2k-1)\epsilon_z < 1 $, then OWFs exist.
> 
> 3. If, for some constant k, all languages in NP have k-round public-coin ZK proofs or arguments satisfying $ \epsilon_c+\epsilon_s+k\epsilon_z < 1 $, then infinitely-often OWFs exist.
