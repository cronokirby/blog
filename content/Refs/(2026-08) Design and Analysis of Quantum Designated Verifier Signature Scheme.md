# Abstract

> Designated Verifier Signatures (DVS) are an important variant of digital signatures that ensure only a specified verifier can validate a signature, while preserving non-transferability. With the advent of quantum computing, several quantum DVS schemes have been proposed to achieve quantum security. In this paper, we revisit the quantum DVS protocol of Xin et al. [Quantum Information Processing, 2022] and provide a structural cryptanalysis of its design. We show that the scheme admits an existential forgery under a chosen-message attack: given a valid quantum signature on one message, an adversary can efficiently transform it into a valid signature on another message without knowledge of the signer’s private key. To address this weakness, we propose a minimal countermeasure based on QKD-derived keys and quantum one-time pad encryption.
