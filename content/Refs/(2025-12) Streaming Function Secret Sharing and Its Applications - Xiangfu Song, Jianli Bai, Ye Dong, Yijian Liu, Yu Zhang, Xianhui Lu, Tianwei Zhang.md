# Abstract

> Collecting statistics from users of software and online services is crucial to improve service quality, yet obtaining such insights while preserving individual privacy remains a challenge. Function secret sharing (FSS) is a promising tool for this problem. However, FSS-based solutions still face several challenges for streaming analytics, where messages are continuously sent, and secure computation tasks are repeatedly performed over incoming messages. 
> We introduce a new cryptographic primitive called streaming function secret sharing (SFSS), a new variant of FSS that is particularly suitable for secure computation over streaming messages. We formalize SFSS and propose concrete constructions, including SFSS for point functions, predicate functions, and feasibility results for generic functions. SFSS powers several promising applications in a simple and modular fashion, including conditional transciphering, policy-hiding aggregation, and attribute-hiding aggregation. In particular, our SFSS formalization and constructions identify security flaws and efficiency bottlenecks in existing solutions, and SFSS-powered solutions achieve the expected security goal with asymptotically and concretely better efficiency and/or enhanced functionality.
