# Abstract

> We present hardware implementations of the recently proposed isochronous fixed-weight sampling algorithm by Décio Luiz Gazzoni Filho, Tomás S. R. Silva, Julio López (CiC vol. 1, 2024) and apply them to the post-quantum cryptographic algorithms NTRU-HPS, Streamlined NTRU Prime and Classic McEliece. We offer multiple implementations, optimized for different targets: A high-area high-performance implementation, a lightweight low-area implementation, as well as a side-channel secure implementation using gadget-based masking. We verify the security of our masked implementation using the PROLEAD leakage detection tool. We show that the sampling algorithm results in highly efficient and effective implementations for the NTRU-like schemes, outperforming existing hardware implementations for fixed-weight sampling.
