# Abstract

> Succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (SNARKs) enable the verification of complex computations via short proofs. Recursive proof composition allows long-running or distributed computations to be verified incrementally, but existing approaches exhibit a fundamental trade-off. Folding-based schemes achieve highly efficient recursion but require provers to maintain and communicate large private state, while stateless approaches such as full SNARK recursion and atomic accumulation incur higher prover costs due to the need to produce and verify a full SNARK proof at each step. We introduce holography accumulation, a framework for stateless recursive proving for SNARKs based on the lincheck or checkable subspace arguments. These SNARKs admit a natural decomposition of verification into witness-dependent checks and public polynomial evaluations encoding the computation. We show that the latter, which we call holographic checks, can be accumulated efficiently across recursive steps. To formalize this idea, we introduce generalized bilinear forms (GBF), a linear-algebraic abstraction capturing the holographic verification procedures of several modern SNARKs. Using this abstraction, we construct generic PCD schemes compatible with both univariate and multivariate polynomial commitment schemes, and present an efficient decider that collapses the accumulated checks to a single polynomial evaluation.
