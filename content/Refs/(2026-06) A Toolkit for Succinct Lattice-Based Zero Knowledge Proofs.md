# Abstract

> The development of proof systems whose security relies on the hardness of lattice problems has been a fruitful research area in recent years. By leveraging the techniques introduced in LaBRADOR (Beullens, Seiler, Crypto 2023), the state-of-the-art lattice-based schemes have very fast provers and have output sizes under 100KB for arbitrarily large statements. These proofs are in fact the smallest, and often have the fastest provers, out of all post-quantum schemes.
> 
> In addition to succinctness, many applications also require witness privacy. Achieving this can, in theory, be done by combining LaBRADOR with a linear-size zero-knowledge proof. While such a combination has already been described in the LaBRADOR paper itself, as well as in the works of Albrecht et al. (Eurocrypt 2024) and del Pino et al. (Crypto 2025), its concrete costs remained unexplored.
> 
> In this work, we provide the first concrete construction and implementation that adds zero-knowledge proofs to LaBRADOR by integrating the linear-size zero-knowledge proof from (Lyubashevsky, Nguyen, Plançon, Crypto 2022) into the protocol. We describe the non-trivial challenges that this entails and show practicality of the construction by benchmarking several use-cases. We make the proof system and primitives accessible by extending the LaZer library (Lyubashevsky, Seiler, Steuer, CCS 2024) in a way that they can easily be used in other applications.
