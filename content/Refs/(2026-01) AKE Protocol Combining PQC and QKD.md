# Abstract

> With the advent of quantum computing, which threatens the very foundations of classical cryptography, several authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocols have been proposed, combining classical and post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, and a quantum key distribution (QKD) sub-protocol. The goal being to associate the claimed information theoretic security of QKD, and the security based upon computational assumptions of classical and post-quantum cryptography. To our knowledge, in existing security proofs of such hybrid AKE protocols, the QKD phase is treated as a black box and the impact of establishing the output quantum key appears similar as setting a symmetric key beforehand at the two communicating parties. In this paper, we describe an hybrid AKE protocol and a security model that captures multiple security properties. Our security analysis integrates the security loss induced by the QKD phase as well as that of implied by the classical and post-quantum cryptographic algorithms involved in the protocol.
