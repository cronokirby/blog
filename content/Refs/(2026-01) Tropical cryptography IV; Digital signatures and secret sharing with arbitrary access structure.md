# Abstract

> We use tropical algebras as platforms for a very efficient digital signature protocol.  Security  relies on computational hardness of factoring a given tropical matrix in a product of two matrices of given dimensions; this problem is known to be NP-complete.
> We also offer a secret sharing scheme with an arbitrary access structure where security of the shared secret is based on computational hardness of the same problem.
