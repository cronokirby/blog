# Abstract

> The past several years have seen a rapid rise in practical lattice-based proof systems with linear-sized zero-knowledge proofs forming the foundation of many of the most efficient quantum-safe privacy protocols, and succinct proofs rapidly catching up and surpassing other quantum-safe alternatives in many metrics.  A recent comparison of lattice-based aggregate signatures (Ethereum Foundation, 2025) involving the hash-based aggregate signature scheme Plonky3 and the instantiation of aggregate signatures from Falcon from the LaZer lattice library (Lyubashevsky, Seiler, Steuer, CCS 2024) using LaBRADOR (Beullens, Seiler, Crypto 2023), showed that lattice-based constructions have an advantage in terms of proof size and prover time, but are around an order of magnitude slower with regards to verification time. In general, it appears that slower verification times are the main obstacle to the adoption of succinct lattice-based proof systems.

> In this work, we introduce and implement Orthus, a proof system with sub-linear verification designed for relations that naturally arise in lattice-based constructions. Asymptotically, the verification time grows with the square root of the witness size, and for a concrete example of aggregating Falcon signatures our implementation reduces the verifier running time by a factor of $9X$ when aggregating $2^{17}$ signatures.
