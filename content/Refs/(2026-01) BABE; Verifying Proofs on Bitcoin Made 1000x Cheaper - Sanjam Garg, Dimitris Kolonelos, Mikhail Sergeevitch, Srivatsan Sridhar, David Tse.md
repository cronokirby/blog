# Abstract

> Endowing Bitcoin with the ability to verify succinct proofs has been a longstanding problem with important applications such as scaling Bitcoin and allowing the Bitcoin asset to be used in other blockchains trustlessly. It is a challenging problem due to the lack of expressiveness in the Bitcoin scripting language and the small Bitcoin block space. BitVM2 is the state-of-the-art verification protocol for Bitcoin used in several mainnets and testnets, but it suffers from very high on-chain Bitcoin transaction fees in the unhappy path (over $14,000 in a recent experiment). Recent research BitVM3 dramatically reduces this on-chain cost by using a garbled SNARK verifier circuit to shift most of the verification off-chain, but each garbled circuit is 42 Gibytes in size, so the off-chain storage and setup costs are huge. This paper introduces BABE, a new proof verification protocol on Bitcoin, which preserves BitVM3's savings of on-chain costs but reduces its off-chain storage and setup costs by three orders of magnitude. BABE uses a witness encryption scheme for linear pairing relations to verify Groth16 proofs. Since Groth16 verification involves non-linear pairings, this witness encryption scheme is augmented with a secure two-party computation protocol implemented using a very efficient garbled circuit for scalar multiplication on elliptic curves. The design of this garbled circuit builds on a recent work, Argo MAC, which gives an efficient garbling scheme to compute homomorphic MACs on such curves.
