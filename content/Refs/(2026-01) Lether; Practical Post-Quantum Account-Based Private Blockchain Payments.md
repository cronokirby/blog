# Abstract

> We introduce Lether, the first practical account-based private block-chain payment protocol based on post-quantum lattice assumptions, following the paradigm of Anonymous Zether (FC '19, IEEE S&P '21). The main challenge in building such a protocol from lattices lies in the absence of core building blocks: unbounded-level additively-homomorphic multi-message multi-recipient public key encryption (mmPKE), and event-oriented linkable ring signatures with support for multiple tags (events). To address these issues, we propose a verifiable refreshable additively-homomorphic mmPKE scheme and a plug-and-play event-oriented linkable tag scheme from lattices. We believe both to be of independent interest.
> 
> To achieve unbounded-level homomorphic evaluation in the lattice-based setting without relying on heavy techniques such as bootstrapping or large moduli (e.g., over 60 bits) in fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), we introduce a lightweight and blockchain-friendly mechanism called refresh. Namely, each user is required to verifiably refresh their account after a certain number of transactions. With our tailored parameter settings, the amortized per-refresh costs of communication and computation are only about 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively, of the cost of a transaction.
> 
> We also optimize the implementations of LNP22 lattice-based zero-knowledge proof system (Crypto '22) in the LaZer library (CCS ’24), to support efficient batching of various proof components. Overall, for a typical transaction, the total communication cost becomes about 68 KB, with the associated zero-knowledge proof accounting for about 51 KB of this total. Each of proof generation and verification take a fraction of a second on a standard PC.
> 
> As an additional contribution, we formalize new definitions for Anonymous Zether-like protocols that more accurately capture real-world blockchain settings. These definitions are generic and are expected to benefit the broader development of account-based private blockchain payment protocols, beyond just lattice settings.
