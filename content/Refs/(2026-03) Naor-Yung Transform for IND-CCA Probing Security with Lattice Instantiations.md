# Abstract

> In this work, we propose novel security notions for encryption schemes that simulate an adversary in the black-box model equipped with additional side-channel power. More concretely, the adversary is allowed to probe values of the secret-key sensitive algorithms, i.e. key generation and decryption. We then prove a generalization of the well-known Naor-Yung (NY) transform, generically lifting IND-CPA secure encryption schemes to IND-CCA ones in this new probing context. Moreover, we instantiate the resulting framework from lattices, constructing Rutile, a masking-friendly IND-CPA encryption scheme inspired by Kyber, and then Topaz its IND-CCA secure extension. In our proposal, the masking-unfriendly parts of Kyber, namely the central binomial distributions and the FO-transform, are replaced by masking-friendly counterparts (sum of uniforms and the aforementioned NY-transform).
