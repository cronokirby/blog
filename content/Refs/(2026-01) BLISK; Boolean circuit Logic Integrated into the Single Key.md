# Abstract

> This paper introduces BLISK, a framework that compiles a monotone Boolean authorization policy into a single signature verification key, enabling only the authorized signer subset to produce the standard constant-size aggregated signatures. BLISK combines (1) $n$-of-$n$ multisignatures to realize conjunctions, (2) key agreement protocols to realize disjunctions, and (3) verifiable group operations (for instance, based on the 0-ART framework). BLISK avoids distributed key generation (allowing users to reuse their long-term keys), supports publicly verifiable policy compilation, and enables non-interactive key rotation.
