# Abstract

> Verifiable Computation on Encrypted Data (VCoED) addresses the computational integrity gap in Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). While recent protocols have made significant strides in making VCoED feasible, server-side proof generation remains computationally intensive, often requiring hours for a modest $2^{20}$-gate payload circuit (e.g., 2.27 hours for Phalanx, 9.26 hours for Blind Fractal). Moreover, most existing schemes lack support for payload circuits that are homomorphically executed with SIMD operations.
> 
> In this work, we present Lasagne, a new efficient VCoED scheme for BGV/BFV-type FHE schemes. Lasagne offers the following:
> 1. It supports multiplicative layered payload circuits and allows them to be homomorphically evaluated under SIMD message encoding, which aligns with the requirements of practical FHE deployment. 
> 2. It achieves efficient prover time while maintaining acceptable communication/verification overhead, and supports flexible parameters choosing to trade off prover time and communication overhead.
> 
> For a 16-layer, $2^{20}$-gate payload circuit, Lasagne generates a 30 MB proof in just 6–12 minutes(single core), achieving an $11\times$–$23\times$ speedup over Phalanx (2.27 hours, 61.4 MB). When the payload natively supports SIMD execution ($2^4$ slots), the proving time further reduces to 4–5 minutes (a $27\times$–$34\times$ speedup). We instantiate Lasagne for a face recognition application built on FHE. Empirical results confirm the validity of our time estimates and the practical viability of the scheme.
