# Abstract

> Fair exchange protocols on blockchain enable atomic exchange of digital goods and cryptocurrency between untrusted parties.
> Two prominent protocols, Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payment (ZKCP) and FairSwap, guarantee fairness: either both parties receive the expected items (digital goods and cryptocurrency) or neither does.
> However, both protocols lack accountability: when an exchange terminates abnormally, the protocol cannot identify which party caused the failure.
> This lack of accountability undermines the applicability of fair exchange protocols in decentralized settings.
> To fill this gap, we identify the common accountability issue in both protocols and revise them by adding signature exchange and chaining.
> We formally define the revised protocols in the universal composability framework and provide a proof sketch, and measure the computational overhead of the revised protocols in our implementation and experiment.
