# Abstract

> We present CHOPIN, a pairing-based multilinear polynomial commitment scheme (PCS) achieving constant proof size and a linear-time prover, constructed modularly from a bivariate PCS. CHOPIN generalizes the recent compilers from univariate to multilinear PCS  MERCURY (Eagen and Gabizon, ePrint 2025/385) and Samaritan (Ganesh, Patranabis, and Singh, ASIACRYPT 2025). Due to its modular design, we obtain a direct proof of knowledge soundness via a reduction to the knowledge soundness of the underlying bivariate PCS in the standard model. In particular, our analysis avoids idealized models such as the Algebraic Group Model.
> 
> When instantiated with the bivariate KZG scheme (Papamanthou, Shi, and Tamassia, TCC 2013), CHOPIN achieves a similar proof size to Mercury and Samaritan while offering a two-fold speedup in the main bottleneck for the prover time, which arises because CHOPIN requires only a single large MSM proportional to the size of the committed multilinear polynomial, in contrast to the two large MSMs required by the prior works, at the cost of one additional pairing for the verifier.
