# Abstract

> Hax is a verification pipeline that translates a subset of Rust into F*, enabling machine-checked proofs of panic freedom and functional correctness for cryptographic implementations being developed in partnership with Google and tested in Signal's post-quantum protocol.
> 
> We study whether hax's translation preserves the security properties it claims to verify. Through a structural analysis of its 35-phase transformation engine, F* proof libraries, and specification API, we identify three classes of semantic gap between the Rust source and the F* verification target: translation infidelity, where pipeline transformations distort security-relevant semantics; unverifiable trust boundaries, where operations are axiomatized without postconditions; and specification gaming, where escape hatches inject unproven facts into the verification context.
> 
> We demonstrate each class through five proof-of-concept exploits against ML-DSA (FIPS 204), ML-KEM (FIPS 203), Ed25519 (FIPS 186-5), and ChaCha20 (RFC 8439). Every exploit meets a strict criterion: the Rust code compiles, passes functional tests, and extracts to F* without warnings, while harboring a security gap invisible to testing.
> 
> We distinguish three gradations: facade gaps where the F* model actively diverges from Rust semantics, a conditional gap dependent on the compilation mode, and a scope gap where the model is faithful but cannot cover a critical property. We call the resulting phenomenon a verification facade: verification that is performed but covers less than it appears to cover.
