> p2panda aims to provide everything you need to build **modern, privacy-respecting and secure local-first applications.**
> We have adopted a **modular approach**—allowing projects the freedom to pick what they need and integrate it with minimal friction. We believe this approach contributes the most to a wider, interoperable p2p ecosystem which outlives “framework lock-in”.
