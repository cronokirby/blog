<h1>Abstract</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Passports, driving licences, and other government-issued identity documents are frequently used to prove attributes about an individual, such as their date of birth or home address. Traditional paper-based approaches are being transitioned to digital identities, which are becoming increasingly important for online interactions and transactions, allowing individuals to prove their identity without needing to present physical documents. However, existing solutions suffer from cumbersome primitives, for example, the European Commission is actively experimenting with Zero-Knowledge proof based solutions for the EU’s Digital Identity Wallet, or lack of functionality such as the UK’s right-to-work share codes.</p>
<p>In this paper, we present a new cryptographic primitive, Policy-Based Access Tokens, that allows for lightweight verification of user attributes through a service (such as a government office). We propose two variants of the scheme: PAT-I offers token unforgeability such that malicious parties cannot verify personal data without a valid token. This is then extended in PAT-II to allow for distributed delegation to a set of proxies, offering fine-grained revocation. We consider stronger security properties that prevent proxies colluding, whilst providing anonymity against the service provider. We give generic constructions of our schemes, prove their security in the standard model, and provide instantiations based on bilinear pairings. Finally, we provide a proof-of-concept implementation which demonstrates that our protocols are efficient, with token verification taking ≈ 100ms.</p></blockquote><section class="footnotes">
