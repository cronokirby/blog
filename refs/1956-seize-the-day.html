<p>A novella, depicting the day in the life of a washed-up actor, as he pleads his aging father for more man, and hides from his wife.</p>
<p>The story really focuses on the psychology of the characters. The plot is quite simple, in terms of actions in the present. Interesting development happens looking backwards, at the major events in the main character's life. But, on this day, nothing major happens, beyond conversations and reminiscing.</p>
<p><em>Bellow</em> manages to capture the subtle psychology of the main character: his timidness, his anger, his pleading with his father, and his wife, his attempts to navigate the shame his father makes him feel. This is capture both in excellent descriptions of the man himself, but also through incisive dialogue. There are very vivid arguments in the book, which develop the relationships between the characters in a descriptive way. The book excels at exposing the dynamics between the actors through their interaction, rather than mere description.</p>
<p>The story also feels like the right length. If it were longer, the plot would not be able to sustain itself. I would also have liked more development towards the ending.</p><section class="footnotes">
