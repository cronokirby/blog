<h1>Cait-Sith Security</h1>




</header>

<p>This serves as an organizing document for the
security analysis of <a href=github.com/cronokirby/cait-sith>Cait-Sith</a>.
This document isn't intended to be a specification
for the protocol itself, rather,
it's intended to analyze the protocol <em>as specified</em>
in the Github repo.
The code in the repo implements the specification in the repo,
and this document investigates the security of that specification.</p>
<p>There are 3 main protocols to look at:</p>
<ul><li>Key Generation (or, key sharing, in its general form)</li><li>Signing (with presignatures)</li><li>Triple generation</li></ul>
<p>Each of these also uses intermediate protocols in their analysis,
which helps simplify the proofs, reusing hard work across the proofs.</p>
<p>Because of this, it's somewhat important to read the documents in order,
since some intermediate protocols will then get used in later documents.</p>
<p>To that effect:</p>
<h1><a href=/notes/2023/04/cait-sith-security-0-preliminaries>Part 0: Preliminaries</a></h1>
<p>This document presents some preliminary information on the security
framework being used (<a href=https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/187>MPS</a>,
which you can think of as being like UC security, in essence),
as well as some notational conventions, and how we structure round communication
and aborts.</p>
<h1><a href=/notes/2023/04/cait-sith-security-1-echo-broadcast>Part 1: Broadcast</a></h1>
<p>One key intermediate protocol is broadcast, which ensures that a party
sends the same message to all other parties.</p>
<h1><a href=/notes/2023/04/cait-sith-security-2-key-sharing>Part 2: Key Sharing</a></h1>
<p>This document looks at the key sharing protocol.
You can think of this as a generalization of key generation to also handle
the cases of refreshing keys, and sharing keys with new parties.</p>
<h1><a href=/notes/2023/04/cait-sith-security-3-triples>Part 3: Triples</a></h1>
<p>This document looks at the triple generation protocol.</p>
<h1><a href=/notes/2023/04/cait-sith-security-4-signing>Part 4: Signing</a></h1>
<p>This document looks at signing, using presignatures.</p><section class="footnotes">
